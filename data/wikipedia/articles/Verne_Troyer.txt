Verne Jay Troyer (January 1, 1969 – April 21, 2018) was an American actor, comedian, and stunt performer best known for playing Mini-Me in the Austin Powers film series. He was notable for having been only 2 ft 8 in (81 cm) tall, the result of cartilage–hair hypoplasia; this made him one of the shortest men in the world.
