Thompson was selected in the first round of the 2011 NBA draft by Golden State with the 11th overall pick. In 2014, he and teammate Stephen Curry set a then NBA record with 484 combined three-pointers in a season, earning the pair the nickname the "Splash Brothers". Thompson is a four-time NBA All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Third Team honoree, and a three-time NBA champion. In 2015, he helped lead the Warriors to their first NBA Championship since 1975, and was a key contributor in the Warriors' 2017 and 2018 titles.
