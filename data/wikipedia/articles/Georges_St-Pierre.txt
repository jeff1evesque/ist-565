Georges St-Pierre (French pronunciation: ​[ʒɔʁʒ sɛ̃ pjɛʁ]; born May 19, 1981), often referred to as GSP, is a Canadian mixed martial artist. He has been on hiatus since December 7, 2017, when he vacated his Middleweight Championship title in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) series due to medical complications from ulcerative colitis, not wanting to hold up the middleweight division. St-Pierre is also a three-time former UFC Welterweight Champion, having won the title twice and the interim title once between November 2006 and April 2008. Frequently cited as one of the greatest fighters in the history of mixed martial arts (MMA), St-Pierre was ranked as the #1 welterweight in the world for several years by Sherdog and numerous other publications. In 2008, 2009 and 2010 he was named the Canadian Athlete of the Year by Rogers Sportsnet. Fight Matrix lists him as the top MMA Welterweight of all time and most accomplished fighter in MMA history. He retired as the reigning Welterweight Champion on December 13, 2013, having held the record for most wins in title bouts and the second longest combined title streak in UFC history (2,204 days) while defending his title 12 consecutive times. He returned to the Octagon in November 2017 at UFC 217, when he defeated Michael Bisping by submission to win the Middleweight title, thus becoming the fourth fighter in the history of the UFC to be a multi-division champion. As of July 26, 2018, he is #5 in the official UFC pound-for-pound rankings.
