Roadkill is an automotive-themed internet show produced by Motor Trend and Hot Rod, two magazines from the Motor Trend Group. It is hosted by former Hot Rod Magazine editor-in-chief David Freiburger and staff editor Mike Finnegan.
Roadkill airs only on the Motor Trend streaming service, formerly Motor Trend On Demand, a monthly subscription service offering this show and other automotive and motorcycle-themed interests. It was also shown free on the Motor Trend YouTube channel until March 19 of 2018 when it was officially announced on the Motor Trend YouTube channel that new episodes of the show would no longer be available to view on YouTube, instead they're now hosted on the Motor Trend website (episodes are still free to view 8 weeks after they've been released to premium subscription members). As of 2015, the show is sponsored by the American automaker Dodge. In August 2015 it was announced that TEN: The Enthusiast Network would be publishing a quarterly magazine named Roadkill, which is based on the show. As of 12 January 2018 Mike Finnegan announced on The Kibbe and Finnegan Show that Roadkill Magazine has been cut due to poor sales on newsstands but that goes with the fails of some of their builds.
