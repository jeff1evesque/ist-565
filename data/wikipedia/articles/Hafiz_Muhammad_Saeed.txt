Hafiz Muhammad Saeed (Urdu: حافظ محمد سعید‬‎, born June 5, 1950) is a Pakistani Islamist militant, who is a co-founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the chief of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah (JuD), a UN-designated terrorist organisation operating mainly from Pakistan. Saeed is an internationally designated terrorist who is influential in Pakistan among certain religious groups. In April 2012, the United States announced a bounty of $10 million on Saeed for his alleged role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 164 civilians including 6 Americans. While India supported the US move, there were protests against it in Pakistan.India considers Saeed a most wanted terrorist because of his ties to Lashkar-e-Taiba and his alleged involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and the 2001 Indian Parliament attack. Saeed is listed on the NIA Most Wanted list and India has banned his organisations LeT and JuD as terrorist organisations. The United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Russia and Australia have also banned Lashkar-e-Taiba. India has demanded that Saeed be handed over to them by Pakistan but there is no extradition treaty between the two countries. Saeed has denied ever being a leader of LeT and said allegations that he planned attacks in India were baseless.
