In tennis, "Battle of the Sexes" is a term that has been used to describe various exhibition matches played between a man and a woman (or, in one case, a doubles match between two men and two women). Most famously, the term is used for a nationally televised match in 1973, held at the Houston Astrodome, between 55-year-old Bobby Riggs and 29-year-old Billie Jean King, which King won in three sets. The match attracted massive attention and was viewed by an estimated 90 million people around the world.  King's win is considered a milestone in public acceptance of women's tennis.
Two other matches commonly referred to as a "battle of the sexes" include a match held four months earlier in 1973 between Riggs and Margaret Court, over the best of three sets, and one in 1992 between Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova, over the best of three sets and hybrid rules favoring the female player, dubbed "The Battle of Champions".At least eight other exhibition matches have been played between notable male and female tennis players, starting in 1888, though only some of them were referred to at the time as a "battle of the sexes".
