Lieutenant Colonel Percy Harrison Fawcett  (18 August 1867 – during or after 1925) was a British geographer, artillery officer, cartographer, archaeologist and explorer of South America. Fawcett disappeared in 1925 (along with his eldest son, Jack, and one of Jack's friends, Raleigh Rimmell) during an expedition to find "Z"—his name for an ancient lost city which he and others believed to exist in the jungles of Brazil.
