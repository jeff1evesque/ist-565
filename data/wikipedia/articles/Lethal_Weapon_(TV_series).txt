The show premiered on Fox on September 21, 2016 and has run for two seasons, with a third season upcoming.For its first two seasons, Lethal Weapon starred Damon Wayans as Roger Murtaugh and Clayne Crawford as Martin Riggs, mismatched detective partners who were also the main characters in the film series, originally played by Danny Glover and Mel Gibson. The series includes other characters directly or loosely inspired by characters from the films, including Leo Getz (played by Thomas Lennon)â€”a close friend of Riggs and Murtaugh.
In May 2018, amidst reports of bad behavior and incidents of hostility between cast and crew on the show's set, Crawford was fired from the show. It was subsequently reported he will be replaced by Seann William Scott, as a new character named Wesley Cole.
