The 2014 NBA Finals was the championship series of the 2013–14 season of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the conclusion of the season's playoffs. The Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeated the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat in five games (4 games to 1) for the Spurs' fifth NBA championship in franchise history. The Spurs outscored the Heat in the series by the largest average point differential (14.0) in Finals history, and ended their chances of a three-peat, the first that would have occurred since the 2000-2002 Los Angeles Lakers, led by Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal. San Antonio's Kawhi Leonard was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP).
This was a Finals rematch from the previous NBA season, which Miami had won in seven games, handing the Spurs the franchise's first-ever Finals defeat in 2013. This marked the 12th Finals rematch, but only the fifth since the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. The Spurs had home-court advantage, since the team finished the regular season with a better record (62–20) than the Heat (54–28). For the first time since 1984, the Finals were played in a 2–2–1–1–1 format (Games 1 and 2 at home for the higher seeded team, Games 3 and 4 at home for the lower seeded team, Game 5 at the higher, Game 6 at the lower, and Game 7 at the higher). The series began on June 5, 2014, and ended on June 15, 2014.
