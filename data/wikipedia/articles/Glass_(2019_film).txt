Glass is an upcoming 2019 American superhero horror-thriller  film written, co-produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. The film is a sequel to Shyamalan's previous films Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2016), cumulatively forming the Unbreakable series, also known as the "Eastrail 177" trilogy. Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard will be reprising their Unbreakable roles, while James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy will be returning as their Split characters, along with Sarah Paulson joining the cast.
While there was interest in creating a sequel to Unbreakable following its release, Touchstone Pictures opted not to finance one at that time despite the film's solid box office performance. Shyamalan set out on writing Split using a character he had written for Unbreakable but pulled from the script due to balance issues. Shyamalan realized the opportunity he had to create a trilogy of works, and adapted the ending of Split to establish the film as within the Unbreakable narrative. This included securing the rights to use Willis's Unbreakable character from Disney, with the promise of including them within the production and distribution of this third film alongside Universal Pictures should it be made. Split was a financial and critical success, and by April 2017, Shyamalan announced that he had started the production process for Glass.
The film is scheduled to be released on January 18, 2019 by Universal Pictures in the United States and by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in international territories.
