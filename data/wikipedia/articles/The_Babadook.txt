The Babadook is a 2014 Australian supernatural psychological horror film written and directed by Jennifer Kent in her directorial debut, and produced by Kristina Ceyton and Kristian Moli√®re. The film stars Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Daniel Henshall, Hayley McElhinney, Barbara West, and Ben Winspear. It is based on the 2005 short film Monster, also written and directed by Kent.
The Babadook was initially not a strong commercial success in Australia and was given a limited release in art house theatres. However, largely after its strong reception at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival, the film generated more attention in the United States and Europe, garnering very positive reviews and grossing $7.5 million against a $2 million budget.
