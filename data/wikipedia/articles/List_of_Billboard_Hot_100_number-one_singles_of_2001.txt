The Billboard Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by Billboard magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical sales, and airplay. In 2001, there were 14 singles that topped the chart, in 52 issue dates. Although 15 singles claimed the top position throughout the year, group Destiny's Child's "Independent Women Part I" is credited in 2000, and is thus excluded.During the year, 12 acts had achieved a first U.S. number-one single, namely: Alicia Keys, Crazy Town, Mary J. Blige, Nickelback, OutKast, and Shaggy all of whom were lead artists, and Ja Rule, Rayvon, and Ricardo "RikRok" Ducent as featured guests. R&B singer MÃ½a, pop singer Pink, and rapper Lil' Kim earned their first number one with a collaborative cover version of the former number one "Lady Marmalade", which also features singer Christina Aguilera. R&B singer Usher and reggae singer Shaggy had two number-one singles in 2001.
Janet Jackson's "All for You" is the longest-running single of the year, staying at number one for seven consecutive weeks. 2001 is the first year since 1993 that there has not been at least one number-one hit with a double-digit run. "All for You" is also responsible to give to Jackson the tenth Hot 100 number one of her career; making her the fourth female artist with most number ones in the rock era. Other singles that had a multiple chart run includes Alicia Keys' "Fallin'" and Mary J. Blige's "Family Affair"; both stayed atop for six weeks.
