Halloween: Resurrection is a 2002 American slasher film and the eighth installment in the Halloween franchise. Directed by Rick Rosenthal, who had also directed Halloween II in 1981, the film builds upon the continuity of Halloween H20: 20 Years Later. Larry Brand and Sean Hood devised the screenplay. It continues with the masked serial killer Michael Myers continuing his murderous rampage in his hometown of Haddonfield. Yet, this time, the killer's old, derelict childhood home is being used for a live internet horror show. It stars Busta Rhymes, Bianca Kajlich, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Ryan Merriman, Sean Patrick Thomas, Katee Sackhoff, Daisy McCrackin, Luke Kirby and Tyra Banks, with Jamie Lee Curtis reprising her role as Laurie Strode.
Halloween: Resurrection was released on July 12, 2002, to widely negative critical reviews, having just a 12% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with many claiming it was an unnecessary sequel to the H20 film. Despite the heavy criticism, Resurrection was somewhat of a box office success, with over $30 million made in the box office. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series was eventually rebooted with Rob Zombie's Halloween.
