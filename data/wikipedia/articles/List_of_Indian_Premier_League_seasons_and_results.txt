The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a domestic, annual Twenty20 cricket tournament in India, organized by the IPL Governing Council, under the aegis of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). It is the most watched Twenty20 tournament and the second-best paying sporting league globally.IPL was established in 2008 and currently consists of eight teams in eight cities across India. The inaugural IPL season was won by Rajasthan Royals. As of May 2018, there have been eleven seasons of the IPL tournament, with the latest eleventh season having been conducted from April to May 2018.The IPL tournament involves each team playing every other team twice in a home-and-away, double round-robin format. At the conclusion of the double round-robin league, the top four teams on the basis of aggregate points qualify for the playoffs. In this stage, the top two teams compete with each other (in a match titled "Qualifier 1"), as do the remaining two teams (in a match titled "Eliminator"). While the winner of Qualifier 1 directly qualifies for the final match, the losing team gets another chance to qualify for the final match by playing the winning team of the Eliminator match; this match is titled Qualifier 2. The winner of this subsequent Qualifier 2 match moves onto the final match. The team that wins the final match is crowned the Indian Premier League champion.Altogether, thirteen teams have played in the past ten seasons of the IPL tournament. Of these, three teams are no longer a part of the tournament. In 2011, BCCI terminated the franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for contractual breach. Similarly, BCCI terminated the franchise of Deccan Chargers in 2012 for backing off from its commitments. In 2013, Pune Warriors India exited IPL after it had a franchise valuation disagreement with BCCI. Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were suspended in 2015 following a betting controversy. However, in July 2017, BCCI announced that both Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals would be allowed back into the IPL competition from the 2018 season. The tournament featured eight teams for the 2018 season, including Delhi Daredevils, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians.Mumbai Indians and current champion Chennai Super Kings are the most successful teams in league history, having won three titles each. Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals, apart from former team Deccan Chargers, are the other teams to have won the tournament title as of May 2018.
