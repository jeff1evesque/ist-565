Mark Anthony Selby (born 19 June 1983) is an English professional snooker player. He is a three-time World Snooker Champion and is the current world number one.Selby joined the main professional snooker tour in 1999 at the age of 16, having played on the UK Challenge Tour in 1998. In 2007, he was runner-up to John Higgins at the World Snooker Championship. After winning three Masters titles in 2008, 2010, and 2013, two UK Championships in 2012 and 2016, and three World Championships in 2014, 2016 and 2017, he became the sixth player to win all of snooker's Triple Crown events at least twice.

Known as a patient, tough competitor with strong safety play, Selby is also a prolific break-builder and has compiled more than 500 century breaks in his professional career. His nickname, "The Jester from Leicester", was given to him by snooker compere Richard Beare after Willie Thorne came up with it during commentary. However, as Selby became more successful, some pundits and fans began to view this nickname with irony. In recent years, Selby became more widely known as "The Torturer", a moniker that was bestowed on him by five-time world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan. Former world champion and now BBC commentator Dennis Taylor has given him the nickname “Sat Nav Selby” due to his knowledge of angles and ability to lay and escape from snookers.
Selby is also a pool player. He was the 2006 WEPF eight-ball pool world champion and was the 2015 Chinese Pool World Championship runner-up.
