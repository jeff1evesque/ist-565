Angus "Mac" MacGyver is a title character and the protagonist in MacGyver. He is played by Richard Dean Anderson. MacGyver works as a troubleshooter for the fictional Phoenix Foundation in Los Angeles. Educated as a scientist and with a background from a fictional United States government agency, the Department of External Services (DXS), he is a resourceful secret agent able to solve a range of problems. In addition to his scientific knowledge and inventive use of common items, he always carries a Swiss Army knife and a roll of duct tape. He prefers non-violent conflict resolution wherever possible and refuses to carry a gun; but will not hesitate to use one as self-preservation (such as the AK47 rifle that he used briefly in the pilot episode). Lucas Till portrays a younger version of MacGyver in the 2016 reboot of the same name.
