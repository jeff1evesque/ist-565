Celebrity Big Brother (or Big Brother VIP) is an adaptation of the Big Brother reality television series. Just like its parent franchise, Celebrity Big Brother airs in several countries, however the housemates or houseguests are local celebrities. In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version.
