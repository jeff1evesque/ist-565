Alexandre Lacazette (French pronunciation: ​[alɛksɑ̃dʁ lakazɛt]; born 28 May 1991) is a French professional footballer who plays as a striker for Premier League club Arsenal and the France national team.
Lacazette came into prominence as a member of the academy at Lyon, where he made his professional debut aged 19. He helped the club win the Coupe de France and Trophée des Champions in 2012, and was named the Ligue 1 Player of the Year in 2014–15. During his time in France, Lacazette cultivated a reputation as a prolific goalscorer and poacher, recording multiple twenty-goal seasons, which earned him a move to Arsenal in a then club-record £46.5 million (€53 million) deal in 2017.Ever since debuting for the national side, Lacazette has represented France across all youth levels. He was a key player in France's victory in the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship, where he scored the match-winning goal in the final against Spain. He then made his senior international debut in June 2013, scoring his first goal in March 2015.
Known for dribbling, pace, and ability with both feet, as well as his persistence to press and tackle when out of possession, Lacazette has been compared to former Arsenal forward Ian Wright by Gérard Houllier.
