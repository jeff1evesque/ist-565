Born in Los Angeles to parents who worked in show business, Stewart began her career as a child actor in 1999.

Following a role in the fantasy film Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), Stewart eschewed parts in big-budget films in favour of independent productions. She featured in the dramas Camp X-Ray and Still Alice (both 2014), and the science fiction romance Equals (2015).
