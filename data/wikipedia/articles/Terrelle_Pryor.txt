Terrelle Pryor Sr. (born June 20, 1989) is an American football wide receiver for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL).
Considered the most recruited high school football-basketball athlete in southwestern Pennsylvania since Tom Clements, Pryor was widely regarded as the nation's top football prospect of 2008, and was named "Junior of the Year" by Rivals.com. Pryor had originally hoped to be a two-sport athlete, as he was also one of the nation's most heralded high school basketball players, but he later chose football.He was the starting quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes from 2008 to 2010, and was drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the third round of the 2011 NFL Supplemental Draft. He then played quarterback for the Raiders from 2011 to 2013 and later spent time with the Seattle Seahawks, Kansas City Chiefs, and Cincinnati Bengals. He converted full-time to wide receiver with the Cleveland Browns in 2015, and also played with the Washington Redskins in 2017.
