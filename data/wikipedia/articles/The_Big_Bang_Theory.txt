The twelfth season is set to premiere on September 24, 2018.

Over time, supporting characters have been promoted to starring roles including: physicist Leslie Winkle, neuroscientist Amy Farrah Fowler, microbiologist Bernadette Rostenkowski, and Stuart Bloom, the cash-strapped owner of the comic book store the characters often visit.

The Big Bang Theory received mixed reviews from critics throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the second and third seasons.
