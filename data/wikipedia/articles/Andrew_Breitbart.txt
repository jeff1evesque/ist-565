Andrew James Breitbart (; February 1, 1969 â€“ March 1, 2012) was an American conservative publisher, writer and commentator.
After helping in the early stages of The Huffington Post and the Drudge Report, Breitbart created Breitbart.com, a news and right-wing opinion website, along with multiple other "BIG" sites - BIGHollywood, BIGGovernment, BIGJournalism. He played central roles in the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal, the firing of Shirley Sherrod, and the ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy. Commenters such as Nick Gillespie and Conor Friedersdorf have credited Breitbart with changing how people wrote about politics by "show[ing] how the Internet could be used to route around information bottlenecks imposed by official spokesmen and legacy news outlets" and "wield[ing] a rhetorical flamethrower in the culture wars" by using his own personal experiences and opinions as the basis for his media career.
