«∑ynn ( «∑ ∆ø ) (also spelled wen, ∆øynn, or ∆øen) is a letter of the Old English alphabet, where it is used to represent the sound /w/.
While the earliest Old English texts represent this phoneme with the digraph ‚ü®uu‚ü©, scribes soon borrowed the rune ∆øynn ·öπ for this purpose.  It remained a standard letter throughout the Anglo-Saxon era, eventually falling out of use (perhaps under the influence of French orthography) during the Middle English period, circa 1300. It was replaced with ‚ü®uu‚ü© once again, from which the modern <w> developed.
The denotation of the rune is "joy, bliss" known from the Anglo-Saxon Rune Poems
·öπ «∑enne bruce√æ, √æe can ∆øeana lytsares and sorge and him sylfa h√¶fbl√¶d and blysse and eac byrga geniht.  [Lines 22-24 in The Anglo-Saxon Runic Poem]Who uses it knows no pain,
sorrow nor anxiety, and he himself has
prosperity and bliss, and also enough shelter. [Translation slightly modified from Dickins (1915)]It is not continued in the Younger Futhark, but in the Gothic alphabet, the letter êçÖ w is called winja, allowing a Proto-Germanic reconstruction of the rune's name as *wunj√¥ "joy".
It is one of the two runes (along with √æ) to have been borrowed into the English alphabet (or any extension of the Latin alphabet). A modified version of the letter ∆øynn called Vend was used briefly in Old Norse for the sounds /u/, /v/, and /w/.
As with √æ, ∆øynn was revived in modern times for the printing of Old English texts, but since the early 20th century the usual practice has been to substitute the modern ‚ü®w‚ü© instead due to ∆øynn's visual resemblance to P.
