Robert Herjavec  (; Croatian: [xěrjaːʋet͡s]; born September 14, 1962) is a Croatian-born Canadian businessman, investor, and television personality. A native of Varaždin, Croatia, he moved to Halifax, Canada after living and working on a farm with his family. After spending his youth in the relative middle class, he gained admission to the University of Toronto where he graduated with a double degree in political science and English.
He began his business career as a film producer and director before joining Logiquest selling IBM mainframe emulation boards. Herjavec eventually rose in the ranks to become general manager, but he left soon after he founded his first company. BRAK Systems, a Canadian integrator of Internet security software, was founded from the basement of his home, and later sold to AT&T Canada in 2000 for $30.2 million. His rapid success in business and connection to television prompted producers to feature him on investing reality shows, such as CBC Television series Dragons' Den, and eventually ABC's version of the series, Shark Tank; he dispenses investment advice and acquires stakes in start-up companies along with his co-stars, Mark Cuban, Lori Greiner, Daymond John, Kevin O'Leary, and Barbara Corcoran. He has written various books on advancing in business including, Driven: How to Succeed in Business and Life (2010) and The Will to Win: Leading, Competing, Succeeding (2013).
