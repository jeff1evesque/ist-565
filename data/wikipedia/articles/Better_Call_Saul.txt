Better Call Saul is an American television crime drama series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a spin-off prequel of Gilligan's prior series Breaking Bad. Set in the early 2000s, Better Call Saul follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer, Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), six years before the events of Breaking Bad, showing his transformation into the persona of criminal-for-hire Saul Goodman. Jimmy becomes the lawyer of former beat cop Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), whose relevant skill set allows him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The show premiered on AMC on February 8, 2015. The 10-episode fourth season started airing August 6, 2018; the show has been renewed for a fifth season.
Jimmy initially works with law firm Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), alongside fellow litigator and romantic interest, Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn). Partners of HHM include Jimmy's nemesis, Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian), and brother, Chuck McGill (Michael McKean). Mike conducts illegal drug-related activity with protégé Nacho Varga (Michael Mando), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito). Odenkirk, Banks and Esposito are all reprising their starring roles from Breaking Bad.
Like its predecessor, Better Call Saul has received critical acclaim, particularly for its acting, writing, and directing, with many critics calling it a worthy successor to Breaking Bad as well as one of the best prequels ever made. It has garnered several nominations, including a Peabody Award, 23 Primetime Emmy Awards, seven Writers Guild of America Awards, five Critics' Choice Television Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and two Golden Globe Awards. The series premiere held the record for the highest-rated scripted series premiere in basic cable history at the time of its airing.
