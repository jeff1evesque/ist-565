Hunt: Showdown is an upcoming video game in development and to be published by Crytek. The game was originally in development at Crytek USA, who wished to create a spiritual successor to Darksiders—a video game series developed by their predecessor, Vigil Games—under the title Hunt: Horrors of the Gilded Age. After the initial announcement in June 2014, Crytek USA was shut down due to financial issues, and the development was brought to the Crytek headquarters. The game, under the new title Hunt: Showdown, was re-announced in May 2017. Hunt: Showdown was launched on Steam in early access on February 22, 2018.
