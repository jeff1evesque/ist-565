Weekend Update is a Saturday Night Live sketch and fictional news program that comments on and parodies current events. It is the show's longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show's first broadcast, and is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance. One or two of the players are cast in the role of news anchor, presenting gag news items based on current events and acting as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests. Chevy Chase has claimed that Weekend Update –  which he started as anchor in 1975 –  paved the way for comedic news shows like The Daily Show and The Colbert Report.
