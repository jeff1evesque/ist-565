This is a list of the U.S. Billboard magazine Hot 100 number-ones of 1992. The longest running number-one single of 1992 is "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston, which stayed at the top of the chart for 14 weeks. "I Will Always Love You" became the longest running song at number one when it reached 14 weeks, breaking the record that Boyz II Men's "End of the Road" had just set at 13 weeks.
"End of the Road" broke the record previously set at 11 weeks by Elvis Presley in 1956 with "Hound Dog"/"Don't Be Cruel". "I Will Always Love You" would hold the record as the longest-running song on the Hot 100 until "One Sweet Day" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men topped the chart for 16 weeks in 1995.
Although "I Will Always Love You" spent nine of its weeks atop the Hot 100 in 1993, it is considered the longest-running song of 1992 because that is when its run began.
