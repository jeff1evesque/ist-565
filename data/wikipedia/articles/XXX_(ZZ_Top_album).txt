XXX is the thirteenth studio album by the American blues rock band ZZ Top, released in 1999. The album's title is a reference to it being thirty years since the band was formed. The live track, "Sinpusher", is an altered version of their 1994 song "Pincushion" with different lyrics and a slightly heavier guitar riff. The album peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200. It was their first album without Bill Ham at the helm as producer.
