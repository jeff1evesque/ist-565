Roger Federer was the top seed and defending champion, but lost in the quarterfinals to Kevin Anderson. 
Novak Djokovic claimed his fourth Wimbledon title, defeating Anderson in the final 6–2, 6–2, 7–6(7–3). The win moved him to 13 grand slam titles, and outright fourth place on the all time men's singles grand slam wins list, passing Roy Emerson. The win was also Djokovic's first title on the ATP tour for over 12 months, his last win coming at Eastbourne on July 1, 2017.The semifinal match between Anderson and John Isner, lasting 6 hours 36 minutes, was the second longest men's singles match at Wimbledon and the third longest men's singles match in tennis history. Isner has thus played in the two longest matches in Wimbledon history (the other one being the record-holding 2010 match against Nicolas Mahut). The 2018 semifinals were the longest two semifinals in Wimbledon history.Anderson became the first man representing South Africa to reach the Wimbledon men's singles final since Brian Norton in 1921 (South African-born Kevin Curren represented the United States when he was a finalist in 1985).Federer and Rafael Nadal were in contention for the ATP No. 1 ranking at the start of the tournament. Nadal retained the top ranking by reaching the fourth round. 
Feliciano López made his 66th consecutive Grand Slam main draw appearance, surpassing the previous record of 65 consecutive appearances he jointly held with Federer.
