Strike is a British television crime drama series, based on the detective novels written by J. K. Rowling, under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, that first broadcast on BBC One on 27 August 2017, after receiving an advance premiere at the British Film Institute on 10 August.The series stars Tom Burke as Cormoran Strike, a war veteran turned private detective operating out of a tiny office in London's Denmark Street, who uses his unique insight and his background as a Special Investigation Branch investigator to solve complex cases that have eluded the police. Burke's casting was confirmed in late 2016, while Holliday Grainger was confirmed to play the role of Robin Ellacott. In early 2017, Kerr Logan was cast in the role of Robin's fianc√©, Matthew.Three adaptations have been broadcast to date, adapting all three current Strike novels: The Cuckoo's Calling, The Silkworm and Career of Evil. Grainger has said that it could be some time before another series is broadcast, stating: "I think they've always been quite clear that they'd never want to write one without basing it on the book. It is all about Jo's writing, and the characters are all about what Jo's written. So, you've got to wait." The series premiered on 1 June 2018 in the United States on Cinemax and in Canada on HBO Canada under the title C.B. Strike.
