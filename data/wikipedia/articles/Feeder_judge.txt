Feeder judges are those judges in the American federal judiciary whose law clerks are often selected to become clerks for the Supreme Court of the United States. Feeder judges are able to place comparatively many of their clerks on the Supreme Court for a variety of reasons, including personal or ideological relationships with particular justices, prestigious and respected positions in the judiciary, and reputations for attracting and training high-quality clerks. Clerkships for the Supreme Court are highly prized and the most difficult to secure in the American clerking landscapeâ€”they have been called the "brass ring of law clerk fame" and the "ultimate achievement." Feeder clerkships are, consequently, similarly prized as stepping stones to a potential clerkship with the Supreme Court.
