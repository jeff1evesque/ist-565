Ivan Perišić (Croatian pronunciation: [ǐʋan pěriʃitɕ]; born 2 February 1989) is a Croatian professional footballer who plays for Internazionale and the Croatia national team. He usually plays as a winger, but can also be deployed as an attacking midfielder or second striker.
A product of the Hajduk Split and Sochaux youth academies, Perišić made a name for himself while playing for Club Brugge, where he was the Belgian Pro League top goalscorer and was named Belgian Footballer of the Year for 2011. This earned him a transfer to Borussia Dortmund, with whom he won the 2011–12 Bundesliga, before signing with VfL Wolfsburg for €8 million in January 2013. He remained there for two and a half seasons, winning the 2015 DFB-Pokal Final, before moving to Inter for €16 million.
Perišić made his debut for the Croatia national team in 2011, and represented his nation at Euro 2012, the 2014 World Cup, Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup, reaching the final of the latter tournament. Instrumental to Croatia's second "golden generation", Perišić is the nation's player with most goals created at the major tournaments (11), and the first Croatian player ever to score in a World Cup Final.
