The 41st Ryder Cup Matches were held in the United States from September 30 to October 2, 2016, at the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minnesota, a suburb southwest of Minneapolis. Europe entered the competition as the cup holders, having won in 2014 in Scotland for their third consecutive win.
The United States won for the first time since 2008 at Valhalla, and featured the most lopsided American victory since a 9-point win in 1981 at Walton Heath. As in 2008, the U.S. never trailed during the tournament. Ryan Moore defeated Lee Westwood by 1 hole to reclaim the Cup with three matches still in progress. Captain Davis Love III dedicated the win to Arnold Palmer, who had died earlier in the week. A bag from Palmer's captaincy in the 1975 Cup was placed on the first tee during Friday's opening foursomes to honor "The King", and Team USA also swept the opening foursomes on Friday morning for the first time since 1975 when Palmer had been captain. Two days after the matches, the majority of Team USA attended Palmer's public memorial in his hometown of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and brought the trophy at the request of Palmer's daughter Amy.
