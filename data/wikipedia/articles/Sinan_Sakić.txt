Sinan Sakić (Serbian Cyrillic: Синан Сакић; 13 October 1956 – 1 June 2018) was a Serbian vocalist of Romani descent. Sakić reached massive popularity as a member in the Yugoslav turbo-folk band Južni Vetar (Southern Wind), but also had a successful career as a single recording artist, until 2014, when his health began to get progressively worse. In total, as a solo performer and a band member, he released 27 albums. Arguably, Sakić was one of the most successful artists of Former Yugoslavia.
