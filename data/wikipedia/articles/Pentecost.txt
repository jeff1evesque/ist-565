The Christian feast day of Pentecost is seven weeks after Easter Sunday: that is to say, the fiftieth day after Easter inclusive of Easter Sunday. It commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus Christ while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles. Some Christians believe that this event represents the birth of the Church. The Feast of the Ascension occurs 40 days after Easter, so Pentecost is a moveable feast. In Eastern Christianity, Pentecost can also refer to the entire 50 days between Easter and the feast, and the book containing the liturgical texts for the period is called the Pentecostarion.
The holy day is also called "White Sunday" or "Whitsunday", especially in the United Kingdom where Whit Monday was also a public holiday (now fixed by statute on the last Monday in May). The Monday after Pentecost is a legal holiday in many European nations.
