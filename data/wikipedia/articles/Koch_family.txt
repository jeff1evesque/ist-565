The Koch family ( KOHK) is an American family engaged in business, most noted for their political activities (donating to conservative and Republican Party causes), and control of Koch Industries, the second-largest privately owned company in the United States (with 2013 revenues of $115 billion). The family business was started by Fred C. Koch, who developed a new cracking method for the refinement of heavy crude oil into gasoline. Fred's four sons litigated against each other over their interests in the business during the 1980s and 1990s.Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch, today commonly referred to as the Koch brothers –  and the only two of Fred Koch's four sons still with Koch Industries –  are affiliated with the Koch family foundations. 
Charles and David Koch have built a political network of conservative donors and the brothers funnel financial revenue into television and multi-media advertising.
