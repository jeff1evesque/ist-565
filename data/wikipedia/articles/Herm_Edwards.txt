Herman Edwards Jr. (born April 27, 1954) is an American football coach and former National Football League (NFL) player. He is currently the head coach at Arizona State University, a position he assumed in December 2017. From 2009 to 2017, he was a pro football analyst for ESPN. He played cornerback for ten seasons (1977â€“1986) with the Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams, and Atlanta Falcons. Prior to his coaching career, Edwards was known best as the player who recovered a fumble by Giants quarterback Joe Pisarcik on a play dubbed the "Miracle at the Meadowlands."
Before being hired as the tenth head coach in Kansas City Chiefs history, Edwards was the head coach of the New York Jets from 2001 to 2005. He is known for his gameday terminology, dubbed "Hermisms" by fans. Of these, the quote and sound bite, "You play to win the game!", a message that Edwards gave during a Jets press conference, became the title of his book, a collection of "leadership lessons" for the reader to use as personal motivation.
