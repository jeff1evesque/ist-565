The election to the 17th Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly  was held from 11 February to 8 March 2017 in 7 phases. This election saw voter turnout of 61.04% compared to 59.40% in the previous election. Bharatiya Janata Party won this election by an overwhelming three-quarter majority of 325 seats with the help of his large number of party workers despite not projecting a chief ministerial candidate before the election. As part of its election strategy BJP contested under a collective leadership and capitalised mostly on the political clout and 'brand' of its leader, Narendra Modi. In the previous election in 2012, the Samajwadi Party had won a majority and formed government in the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav.
On March 18, 2017, Adityanath Yogi was appointed the next CM of Uttar Pradesh. UP BJP Chief Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dr. Dinesh Sharma were appointed as the Deputy CM.
