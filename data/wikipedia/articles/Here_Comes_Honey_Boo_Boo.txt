Here Comes Honey Boo Boo is an American reality television series that aired on TLC featuring the family of child beauty pageant contestant Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson. The show premiered on August 8, 2012 and ended on August 14, 2014. Thompson and her family originally rose to fame on TLC's reality series Toddlers & Tiaras. The show revolves around Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson and "Mama" June Shannon, and their family's adventures in the town of McIntyre, Georgia. The reality series received predominantly negative reviews from television critics during its run.
On October 24, 2014, TLC cancelled the series after four seasons, following rumours stating that cast member June Shannon started dating a man who was a registered sex offender, which both Shannon and her older daughter Lauryn denied. A number of episodes had already been taped for a fifth season, but went unaired until April 21, 2017, when TLC aired four of the episodes as the two-hour special Here Comes Honey Boo Boo: The Lost Episodes.
