The fifth season of the television comedy series Arrested Development premiered on Netflix on May 29, 2018. The season will consist of 16 episodes, split into two eight-episode parts; with the second half premiering later in 2018. This is the second revival season after the series was canceled by Fox in 2006; the fourth season premiered in 2013.
The show's storyline centers on the Bluth family, a formerly wealthy, habitually dysfunctional family, and the show incorporates hand-held camera work, narration, archival photos, and historical footage.
One central storyline of season five is a "whodunit" regarding the mysterious disappearance of Lucille Austero in the very midst of her congressional campaign. The season also features the cast together more frequently, as season four primarily had the cast separated due to scheduling difficulties.
