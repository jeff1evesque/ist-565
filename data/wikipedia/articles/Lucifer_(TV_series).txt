Lucifer is an American fantasy police procedural drama television series developed by Tom Kapinos that premiered on Fox on January 25, 2016. It is based on the DC Comics character created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth, and Mike Dringenberg taken from the comic book series The Sandman, who later became the protagonist of a spin-off comic book series, both published by DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. The series revolves around Lucifer Morningstar (Tom Ellis), the Devil, who abandons Hell for Los Angeles where he runs his own nightclub and becomes a consultant to the LAPD. The ensemble and supporting cast include Lauren German as Detective Chloe Decker, Kevin Alejandro as Detective Daniel "Dan" Espinoza, D. B. Woodside as Amenadiel, Lesley-Ann Brandt as Mazikeen and Rachael Harris as Dr. Linda Martin. Filming took place in Vancouver, British Columbia before production was relocated to Los Angeles, California beginning with the third season.
The series received initially mixed reviews from critics during its first season, though the second and third seasons drew more favorable acclaim. Praise was directed at Ellis' performance and the series' style of humor. Despite initially high viewership for its debut, ratings remained consistently low throughout the series' run on Fox. On May 11, 2018, Fox canceled Lucifer after three seasons. A month later, Netflix picked up the series for a fourth season of ten episodes, which is set to be released in 2019.
