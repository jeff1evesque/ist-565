Gregor Clegane, nicknamed "The Mountain That Rides" or simply "The Mountain", is a fictional character in the A Song of Ice and Fire series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation Game of Thrones. In the books, the character is initially introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones. He subsequently appeared in A Clash of Kings (1998), A Storm of Swords (2000) and in A Dance with Dragons (2011).
An infamous knight and retainer to House Lannister, he is well known for his size, prowess in battle, extremely cruel nature, and uncontrollable temper. He is also the older brother of Sandor "The Hound" Clegane; the two are mortal enemies ever since Gregor gruesomely scarred Sandor by shoving his face into a brazier when they were children. He later becomes the personal bodyguard of Cersei Lannister under the name Robert Strong.
In the HBO television adaptation, Clegane was originally portrayed by Australian actor Conan Stevens in season one, and by Welsh actor Ian Whyte in season two; Icelandic actor and strongman Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson took over the role from season four onwards.
