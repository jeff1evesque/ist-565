Toxin or the Toxin symbiote is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics universe.  He is the third major symbiote of the Spider-Man series, the ninth known to have appeared in the comics outside of the Planet of the Symbiotes storyline, and the first symbiote that Spider-Man considers an ally, despite temporary alliances with Venom on numerous occasions. The first host of the Toxin symbiote is former NYPD police officer Patrick Mulligan. Toxin later bonded to Eddie Brock as his second host after Patrick Mulligan was killed.
Patrick Mulligan will make his live-action debut in the 2018 film  Venom, portrayed by Reid Scott.
