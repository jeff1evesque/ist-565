The Blacklist is an American crime drama series created by Jon Bokenkamp that premiered on NBC on September 23, 2013.

Raymond "Red" Reddington (James Spader), one of the FBI's most wanted fugitives, surrenders at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C.  He claims that he and the FBI have similar interests in getting rid of dangerous criminals and terrorists. Reddington will cooperate only with Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone), a rookie FBI profiler who we see in the first episode, has trouble profiling just herself. However, Keen is not too keen on the idea. Over the course of his own criminal career, Reddington has made a list of global criminals who he believes are acting liabilities to his own interests or to society, most of whom are unknown to the FBI, and not on the "Most Wanted" list. He calls it "The Blacklist". As the series progresses, Reddington uses the FBI to apprehend enemies and strategic interests for his own personal gain.
