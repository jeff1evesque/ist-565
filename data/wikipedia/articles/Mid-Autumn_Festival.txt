The Mid-Autumn Festival is a harvest festival celebrated notably by ethnic Chinese and Vietnamese peoples. The festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month of the lunar calendar with full moon at night, corresponding to late September to early October of the Gregorian calendar with a full moon at night.Due to ancient China's cultural influence, the Mid-Autumn Festival has spread to other parts of Southeast Asia. However, the way in which different countries celebrate it varies. Mooncakes, which are traditionally eaten during this festival have also appeared in western countries as an exotic sweet.
