Ashura (Arabic: عاشوراء‎ ʻĀshūrā’, colloquially: /ʕa(ː)ˈʃuːraʔ/; Urdu: عاشورا‬‎; Persian: عاشورا‎ /ɒːʃuːˈɾɒ/; Azerbaijani and Turkish: Aşura Günü or English: Day of Remembrance), and in Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Suriname as 'Hussay' or Hosay, is the tenth day of Muharram in the Islamic calendar.In Sunni Islam, Ashura also marks the day that Moses and the Israelites were saved from Pharaoh by God creating a path in the Sea, and is the Islamic equivalent to Yom Kippur. Other commemorations include Noah leaving the Ark and Muhammad's arrival in Medina.For the majority of Shi'a Muslims, Ashura marks the climax of the Remembrance of Muharram, and commemorates the death of Husayn ibn Ali, the grandson of Muhammad at the Battle of Karbala on 10 Muharram in the year 61 AH (in AHt: October 10, 680 CE). Sunni Muslims have the same accounts of these events, however ceremonial mourning did not become a custom - although poems, eulogizing and recounting the events were and continue to be common. Mourning for the incident began almost immediately after the Battle of Karbala. Popular elegies were written by poets to commemorate the Battle of Karbala during the Umayyad and Abbasid era, and the earliest public mourning rituals occurred in 963 CE during the Buyid dynasty.
In Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, India and Pakistan, Ashura has become a national holiday, and many ethnic and religious communities participate in it.
