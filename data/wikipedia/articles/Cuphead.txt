Cuphead (subtitled "Don't Deal with the Devil") is a run and gun indie video game developed and published by StudioMDHR. First announced in 2014, the game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox One in September 2017.
Cuphead was inspired by the rubber hose style of animation used in cartoons of the 1930s, such as the work of studios Fleischer and Walt Disney Animation, seeking to emulate their subversive and surrealist qualities. The game features one or two players taking control of animated characters Cuphead and his brother Mugman to fight through several levels that culminate in boss fights as to repay their debt to the devil.
Cuphead was praised for its art style and noted for its challenging difficulty, it was both a critical and commercial success, selling over three million copies by August 2018. The game won several year-end awards for its art, animation, and music.
