Dandeny Muñoz Mosquera, also known as "La Quica" (Colombian slang for "the fat girl") was purported to be the chief assassin for the Medellín Cartel of Colombia.  He was responsible for the deaths of an unknown number of people (estimates range in the hundreds), having supposedly murdered members of both the Medellín Cartel and the rival Cali Cartel, as well as police officers and government officials. Among his crimes is the 1989 bombing of Avianca Flight 203, which killed 110 civilians. He is described as "the Al Capone of the drug-murder circuit".
