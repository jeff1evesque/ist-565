Jeffree Star (born Jeffrey Lynn Steininger Jr.; November 15, 1985) is an American Internet celebrity, makeup artist, entrepreneur, and musician. He is the founder and owner of Jeffree Star Cosmetics.
By 2006, Star had become the most followed person on MySpace. He frequently used the platform to promote his music career. In 2009, Star released his first and only studio album, Beauty Killer (2009), which included songs such as "Lollipop Luxury" featuring Nicki Minaj. He embarked on several world tours to promote his music. In 2010, he signed to Akon—who described Star as "the next Lady Gaga"—with plans to release a second album. However, it was never released and Star abruptly left the music industry in 2013 under unclear circumstances.
The following year, he founded his own cosmetics company, Jeffree Star Cosmetics; he subsequently began promoting the brand on YouTube, where he has since amassed more than 10 million subscribers and over 1 billion views, as of 2018.
