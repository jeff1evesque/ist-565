Otōemon Hiroeda (廣枝音右衛門(広枝音右衛門), Hiroeda Otōemon, December 23, 1905 – February 23, 1945) was a Japanese police officer posted to Zhunan, Miaoli in Japanese-era Taiwan. During the Pacific War, he disobeyed orders that he sacrifice the lives of 2000 Taiwanese soldiers under his command in a suicidal attack, and then killed himself. His actions resulted in a spirit tablet for him being enshrined within Quanhua Temple on Lion Head Mountain, Miaoli County, Taiwan.
