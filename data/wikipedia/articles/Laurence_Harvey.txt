Laurence Harvey (born Laruschka Mischa Skikne; 1 October 1928 â€“ 25 November 1973) was a Lithuanian-born South African-raised actor. In a career that spanned a quarter of a century, Harvey appeared in stage, film and television productions primarily in the United Kingdom and  the United States. His performance in Room at the Top (1959) resulted in an Academy Award nomination. That success was followed by the role of William Barret Travis in The Alamo (1960), and as the brainwashed Raymond Shaw in The Manchurian Candidate (1962).
