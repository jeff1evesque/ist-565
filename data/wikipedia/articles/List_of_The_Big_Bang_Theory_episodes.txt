The Big Bang Theory is an American comedy television series created and executively produced by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady. Like the name of the series itself (with the exception of the first episode "Pilot"), episode titles of The Big Bang Theory always start with "The" and resemble the name of a scientific principle, theory or experiment, whimsically referencing a plot point or quirk that is stated in that episode.
In March 2017, CBS announced that the series was renewed for two more years, leading the show to a total of 12 seasons. As of  May 10, 2018, 255 episodes of The Big Bang Theory have aired, concluding the eleventh season. There was also an unaired pilot which CBS did not broadcast. The twelfth season is set to premiere on September 24, 2018, and will consist of 24 episodes; it will be the series' final season.
