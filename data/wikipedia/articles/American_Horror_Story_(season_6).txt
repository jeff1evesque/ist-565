American Horror Story: Roanoke is the sixth season of the FX horror anthology television series American Horror Story. It premiered on September 14, 2016, marking the first time the series has debuted outside of October, and concluded on November 16, 2016.
Returning cast members from previous seasons include: Lily Rabe, Sarah Paulson, Angela Bassett, Adina Porter, Kathy Bates, Denis O'Hare, Wes Bentley, Cheyenne Jackson, Lady Gaga, Evan Peters, Frances Conroy, Leslie Jordan, Finn Wittrock, Robin Weigert, and Taissa Farmiga, along with new cast members Cuba Gooding Jr. and Andr√© Holland. Paulson also reprised her role as the Asylum character, Lana Winters, for the season finale. 
Prior to the premiere, series co-creator Ryan Murphy stated this season of the series would be "more rogue" and "dark" in contrast to its previous cycle, Hotel. Details about its plot and cast were kept secret until the first episode aired, an unusual approach to publicity for the series. As such, it became the first iteration of the series to not release a subtitle prior to the season premiere since its debut. Several potential themes were theorized based on various promotional material produced by FX. After the release of pictures taken from the set in Santa Clarita, it was widely speculated that the season would incorporate the infamous 1580s Roanoke Colony disappearance. The premiere episode revealed the season to be depicted as a paranormal documentary entitled My Roanoke Nightmare which reenacts the experiences of a married couple who relocate to North Carolina. Roanoke has received positive reviews, with critics noting its subdued aesthetic and pacing in comparison to earlier seasons of the series.
