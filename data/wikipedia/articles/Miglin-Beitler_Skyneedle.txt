The Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle was a proposed 125-floor skyscraper intended for Chicago, United States, by Lee Miglin and J. Paul Beitler and designed by architect César Pelli. The site of the proposed Skyneedle now is host to a parking garage. If it had been built in 1998, the 610 m (2,000 ft) tall Miglin-Beitler Skyneedle would have been the tallest building in the world.However, across the street (Wells Street) from the parking garage is another Pelli project, 181 West Madison Street, which reportedly inspired the general design of the Skyneedle. Visually the upper floors of the Skyneedle do appear to be similar to a stretched 181 W Madison.
César Pelli also designed the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur. The Petronas Towers have an obvious design reference, with the exception of having round floorplates as opposed to square ones.
