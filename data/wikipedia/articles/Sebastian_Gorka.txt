Sebastian Lukács Gorka (Hungarian: Gorka Sebestyén Lukács) (born 1970) is a British-born Hungarian-American military and intelligence analyst, who was a deputy assistant to US President Donald Trump in 2017. He served from January 2017 until August 25, 2017, when, according to Gorka, he resigned because he believed White House officials were undermining the Make America Great Again platform. Other sources reported that he had been asked to leave the administration. He is currently a Fox News contributor.Gorka was born in the United Kingdom to Hungarian parents, lived in Hungary from 1992 to 2008, and in 2012 became a naturalized American citizen. Gorka has written for a variety of publications, is generally considered politically conservative and has ties to the alt-right, though he rejects the term, calling it "bogus" and "a new label for nationalists or irredentist bigots".During his time in the Trump administration, Gorka gave a series of combative interviews with the press in which he defended the administration's positions on national security and foreign policy. Various national security scholars in academic and policymaking circles have characterized Gorka as fringe. Some critics have challenged his academic credentials, his views on Islam and radicalization—as well as his motives for identifying with the Order of Vitéz or supporting the EU-banned Hungarian Guard.
