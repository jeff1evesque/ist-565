Since the debut of the anime adaptation of Satoshi Tajiri's Pokémon games, Toho has distributed the theatrical films based on the franchise since 1998 in Japan: five based on the original series Pokémon anime, four based on the Advanced Generation series, four based on the Diamond and Pearl series, with the tenth film commemorating the tenth anniversary of the anime, three based on the Best Wishes series, three based on the XY series, and two based on the new alternate continuity, despite the Sun & Moon series. There are also two television specials that were broadcast on TV Tokyo and ten short films.
Theatrical films, with little exception, center on and feature Pokémon (typically legendary ones) that have yet to officially debut in the games, often with the Pokémon causing some sort of disaster with its powers or being pursued by someone with less-than-noble tendencies. Ash and his friends will often befriend a Pokémon during the movie and must, at the end, say goodbye to their new friend.
The locations in which the movies take place have been, since Pokémon Heroes, based on a real-world location outside Japan. Topics explored are typically deeper than those explored in the episodes aired on TV, with the battle between greedy people who would use Pokémon for evil and those like Ash who are friends and partners to their Pokémon being a central issue in several movies.
Warner Bros. licensed the first three films in North America, and Miramax Films licensed the following four films. Starting with Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew, Viz Media is the only North American licensee. Warner Bros. will also distribute the live-action adaptation of Detective Pikachu. All Pokémon films have been and will be distributed theatrically by Toho within Japan.
