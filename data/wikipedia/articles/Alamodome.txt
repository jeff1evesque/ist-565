The Alamodome is a domed 64,000-seat, multi-purpose facility used as a football, basketball, soccer,  baseball stadium, and convention center. It is located on the southeastern fringe of Downtown San Antonio, Texas, United States. The facility opened on May 15, 1993, having been constructed at a cost of US$186 million.
The multi-purpose facility was intended to increase the city's convention traffic and attract a professional football franchise.  It also placated the San Antonio Spurs' demands for a larger arena.  The Spurs played in the Alamodome for a decade, then became disenchanted with the facility and convinced Bexar County to construct a new arena for them, now called the AT&T Center. The Alamodome's biggest regular tenant is currently the UTSA Roadrunners.
