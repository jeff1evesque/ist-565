The Nikki Catsouras photographs controversy concerns the leaked photographs of Nicole "Nikki" Catsouras (March 4, 1988 â€“ October 31, 2006), who died at the age of 18 in a high speed car crash after losing control of a Porsche 911 Carrera, which belonged to her father, and colliding with a toll booth in Lake Forest, California. Photographs of Catsouras' badly disfigured body were published on the internet, leading her family to take legal action due to the distress this caused.
