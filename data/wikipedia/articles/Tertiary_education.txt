Tertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and postsecondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as trade schools and colleges. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education beyond secondary education is known as further education in the United Kingdom, or continuing education in the United States.
Tertiary education generally culminates in the receipt of certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.
The UNESCO stated that tertiary education focuses on learning endeavors in specialized fields. It includes academic and higher vocational education.
