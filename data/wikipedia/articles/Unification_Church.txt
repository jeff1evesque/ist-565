It was officially founded under the name Holy Spirit Association for the Unification of World Christianity (HSA-UWC) in Seoul, South Korea in  1954, by Sun Myung Moon, a Korean religious leader also known for his business ventures and engagement in social and political causes.The movement is a spiritually-based movement of legally independent organizations.  It is sometimes known as the Unification Church, however its members point out that Moon repeatedly proclaimed the "end of religion" and his desire to not have a "church" so that hence movement is a more apt way of describing the theology, organizations, and individuals associated with him.   The movement has had strong criticism and has attracted numerous controversies, including that of being a dangerous cult.  Its involvement in politics has also been criticized.  The beliefs of the Unification movement, expressed in the book Divine Principle, have been criticized by both Jewish and Christian scholars.
