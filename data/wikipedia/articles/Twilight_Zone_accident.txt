On July 23, 1982, a Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter crashed at Indian Dunes in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California, during the making of Twilight Zone: The Movie. The crash killed three people on the ground (actor Vic Morrow and two child actors, Myca Dinh Le and Renee Shin-Yi Chen) as well as injured the six helicopter passengers, including the director, John Landis. The incident led to years of civil and criminal action and was directly responsible for the introduction of new procedures and safety standards in the filmmaking industry.
