Philip Michael Rivers (born December 8, 1981) is an American football quarterback for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at NC State, and was drafted in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft with the fourth overall pick by the New York Giants, who traded him to the Chargers for their first overall pick, quarterback Eli Manning. Rivers' career passer rating of 94.6 is ninth-best all-time among NFL quarterbacks with at least 1,500 passing attempts. Rivers is ranked 4th all-time in consecutive starts by a quarterback in NFL history, and is the current active iron man in that position.
After starting Chargers' quarterback Drew Brees went to the New Orleans Saints following the 2005 season, Rivers led the Chargers to a 14-2 record in his first season as a starter. In 2007, he helped the Chargers win their first playoff game since 1994 after beating the Tennessee Titans in the wildcard round of the 2007 playoffs and eventually leading them to the AFC Championship Game. Rivers has been selected to the Pro Bowl seven times, and was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year in 2013.
