Series Twelve of Britain's Got Talent, a British talent competition series, began broadcasting in the UK during 2018, from 14 April to 3 June 2018. For this series, the live episodes were broadcast from Hammersmith Apollo, and presented by Declan Donnelly only; while Anthony McPartlin suspended his TV commitments on 19 March 2018, he still appeared in the audition episodes as these had already been filmed in January and February earlier that year. Compared to previous years, this series featured a higher number of participants for the judges to select semi-finalists from, not counting those who received the Golden Buzzer, and saw the return of the Judges' Vote to the show's format.
The twelfth series was won by stand-up comedian Lost Voice Guy, with comedy singer/pianist Robert White finishing in second place and reggae singer Donchez Dacres in third place. During its broadcast, the series averaged around 8.3 million viewers.
