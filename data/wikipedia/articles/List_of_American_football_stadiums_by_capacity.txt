The following is an incomplete list of current American football stadiums ranked by capacity. The list contains the home stadiums of all 32 professional teams playing in the NFL as well as the largest stadiums used by college football teams in the NCAA. The largest professional team stadium falls at number 16 on the list.
Not included are several large stadiums used by teams in the now-defunct NFL Europa, as these were all built for and used mainly for association football, or Rogers Centre, located in Canada (although it does host occasional American football games). Currently all football stadiums with a capacity of 30,000 or more are included.
Stadiums are ordered by seating capacity.  This is intended to represent the permanent fixed seating capacity, when the stadium is configured for football.  Some stadiums can accommodate larger crowds when configured for other sports, or by using temporary seating or allowing standees.
