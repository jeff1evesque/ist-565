Friendship Day, mona Chinese: 国际友谊日, French: Journée internationale de l’amitié, Russian: Международный день дружбы, Spanish: Día del Amigo, Hindi: मित्रता दिवस) is a day for celebrating friendship.. The day is a popular celebration in several Asian countries since it was first proposed in 1958 in Paraguay as the 'International Friendship Day'.
Initially created by the greeting card industry, evidence from social networking sites shows a revival of interest in the holiday that may have grown with the spread of the Internet, particularly in India, Bangladesh, and Malaysia. Digital communication modes such as the Internet and cell phones may be helping to popularize the custom, since greeting friends en masse is now easier than before.
Those who promote the holiday in South Asia attribute the tradition of dedicating a day in honor of friends to have originated in the United States in 1935, but it actually dates from 1919. The exchange of Friendship Day gifts like flowers, cards and wrist bands is a popular tradition of this occasion.Friendship Day celebrations occur on different dates in different countries. The first World Friendship Day was proposed for  30 July in 1958, by the World Friendship Crusade. On  27 April 2011 the General Assembly of the United Nations declared  30 July as official International Friendship Day. However, some countries, including India, celebrate Friendship Day on the first Sunday of August. In Oberlin, Ohio, Friendship Day is celebrated on 8 April each year.
