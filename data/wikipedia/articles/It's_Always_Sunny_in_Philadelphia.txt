It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is an American sitcom that first premiered on FX on August 4, 2005 and has since moved to FXX beginning with the ninth season. It was created by Rob McElhenney who developed it with Glenn Howerton. It is executive produced and primarily written by McElhenney, Howerton, and Charlie Day, all of whom star alongside Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito. The series follows the exploits of "The Gang", a group of debauched, self-centered friends who run the Irish bar Paddy's Pub in South Philadelphia.
