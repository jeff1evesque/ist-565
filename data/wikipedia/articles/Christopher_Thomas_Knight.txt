Christopher Thomas Knight (born 7 December 1965), also known as the North Pond Hermit, is a former hermit who lived almost without human contact for 27 years in the woods in the North Pond area of Maine.Knight lived within about a mile of summer cabins throughout his entire hermitage in a crude camp he built in a well-drained woodland obscured within a cluster of glacial erratic boulders. Because he entered the woods with almost no possessions, his camp was composed entirely of items stolen from nearby cabins and camps. He survived by committing approximately 1,000 burglaries against houses in the area, at a rate of approximately 40 per year.Apart from the fear and notoriety his many burglaries created in the local area, Knight's unusual life also attracted widespread international media reports upon his capture.
