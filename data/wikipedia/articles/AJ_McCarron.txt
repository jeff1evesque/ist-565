Raymond Anthony "AJ" McCarron Jr. (born September 13, 1990) is an American football quarterback for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Alabama and was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fifth round of the 2014 NFL Draft. McCarron won the BCS National Championship in 2011 against LSU and 2012 against Notre Dame, becoming the first quarterback to win back-to-back consensus national championships in the BCS era. McCarron is one of only seven quarterbacks in history to win back-to-back titles in some form and the first FBS quarterback to win back-to-back consecutive titles since Nebraska's Tommie Frazier in 1994 and 1995. In addition, since his freshman/redshirt year, McCarron has been associated with three national title teams under coach Nick Saban: 2009, 2011, and 2012.
