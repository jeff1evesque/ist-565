Leonardo Bonucci (Italian pronunciation: [leoˈnardo bɔnuttʃi]; born 1 May 1987) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Serie A club Juventus and the Italy national team.
After beginning his career with Inter in 2005, Bonucci spent the next few seasons on loan at Treviso and Pisa, before moving to Bari in 2009. His technique, ball-playing ability and defensive performances alongside fellow Italian centre-back Andrea Ranocchia earned him a move to Juventus the following season, where he later became a key member of the club's three-man defensive line, alongside Giorgio Chiellini and Andrea Barzagli, establishing himself as one of the best defenders in world football. He went on to win six consecutive Serie A titles with the team between 2012 and 2017. In 2017, he moved to Milan, and one season later returned to Juventus.
At international level, Bonucci has represented Italy at two FIFA World Cups (2010 and 2014), two European Championships (2012 and 2016), and a FIFA Confederations Cup (2013), winning a runners-up medal at Euro 2012, and a third-place medal at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.
Bonucci has also won several individual honours for his performances: he was named to the UEFA Europa League Squad of the season during the 2013–14 season, and is a two-time member of the Serie A Team of the Year; he was named the Serie A Footballer of the Year in 2016, and was also included in the UEFA Team of the Year in the same season.
