The Aleppo offensive of Septemberâ€“October 2016 was the military operation launched in Aleppo in late September 2016 by the Syrian Army and its allies aiming to capture all of the remaining rebel-held parts of the city of Aleppo. Rebel forces controlling East Aleppo at that time were primarily fighters of Fatah Halab (which includes FSA units), although a significant number of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and Ahrar al-Sham fighters were also present.
