WWE Payback was a professional wrestling event produced annually by WWE, a Connecticutâ€“based promotion, and broadcast live and available through pay-per-view (PPV). The event was established in 2013, replacing No Way Out in the June slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. In 2015, the event moved to the May slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. WWE swapped dates between Payback and Extreme Rules in 2016, with Payback taking place on May 1 and Extreme Rules taking place on May 22; making this event as a post-WrestleMania pay-per-view event. 
With the brand extension reinstated after Battleground PPV event in 2016, the 2017 edition of the event was moved to the late April slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar and being made as a Raw-exclusive pay-per-view event. The event was expected to return in 2018, as a SmackDown branded event. However, the event was taken off of WWE's PPV lineup as all events after WrestleMania 34 became dual-branded.
Championship bouts are scheduled on every card, with the lower-tier titles featured on the undercard and the top-tier featured on the main card.
