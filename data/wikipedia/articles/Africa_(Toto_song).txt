"Africa" is a song by the American rock band Toto. It was included on their fourth studio album Toto IV, and released as a single on September 30, 1982. It reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart on February 5, 1983 (the band's only Billboard number one), and number three on the UK Singles Chart the same month. The song was written and composed by the band members David Paich and Jeff Porcaro.
In the late 2010s, "Africa" became popular as an Internet meme. In response to this resurgence and the repeated requests of a fan, the band Weezer recorded a cover version in 2018 that peaked at number 54 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.
