Davy Jones is a fictional character in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, portrayed by Bill Nighy. He appears in the second film Dead Man's Chest and returns in the third film At World's End. He is the captain of the Flying Dutchman (based on the ghost ship of the same name).
The computer-generated imagery used to complete Jones was named by Entertainment Weekly as the tenth favorite computer generated film character in film history, behind King Kong  in 2007. The work on Davy Jones by Industrial Light and Magic earned them the 2006 Academy Award for Visual Effects for Dead Man's Chest.
The character is based on the superstition of Davy Jones' Locker.
