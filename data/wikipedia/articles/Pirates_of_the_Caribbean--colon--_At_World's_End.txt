Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a 2007 American epic fantasy swashbuckler film directed by Gore Verbinski, the third in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series and the sequel to Dead Man's Chest (2006). The plot follows Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann, Hector Barbossa, and the crew of the Black Pearl rescuing Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones's Locker, and then preparing to fight the East India Trading Company, led by Cutler Beckett, who controls Davy Jones and plans to extinguish piracy forever. It is the last film in the series to be directed by Verbinski. It was filmed in two shoots during 2005 and 2006, the former simultaneously with Dead Man's Chest. With an estimated production budget of $300 million, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End was the most expensive film ever made at the time of its release, even after adjusting for inflation.
Walt Disney Pictures released the film in the United States on May 25, 2007. Critical reviews were mixed; the film was praised for its performances, musical score, action scenes, and special effects, but was criticized for its plot and running time. Despite this, At World's End was a box office hit, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2007 with over $960 million. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling and the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, which it lost to La Vie en Rose and The Golden Compass, respectively. A sequel, On Stranger Tides, the first in the series to neither be directed by Verbinski nor star Bloom and Knightley, was released on May 20, 2011.
