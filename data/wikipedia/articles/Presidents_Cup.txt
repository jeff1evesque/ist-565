The Presidents Cup is a series of men's golf matches between a team representing the United States and an International Team representing the rest of the world minus Europe (i.e. Asia, Africa, Central and South America, Oceania, Mexico and Canada). Europe competes against the United States in a similar but considerably older event, the Ryder Cup.
The Presidents Cup has been held biennially since 1994. Initially it was held in even numbered years, with the Ryder Cup being held in odd numbered years. However, the cancellation of the 2001 Ryder Cup due to the September 11 attacks pushed both tournaments back a year, and the Presidents Cup is now held in odd numbered years. It is hosted alternately in the United States and in countries represented by the International Team.
