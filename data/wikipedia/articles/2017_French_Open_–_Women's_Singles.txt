Garbiñe Muguruza was the defending champion, but lost to Kristina Mladenovic in the fourth round. Muguruza's defeat—along with those of Svetlana Kuznetsova, Venus Williams and Samantha Stosur in the same round—ensured that for the first time in a Grand Slam tournament since the 1979 Australian Open, none of the quarterfinalists were former Grand Slam champions.Jeļena Ostapenko won the title, defeating Simona Halep in the final, 4–6, 6–4, 6–3.		
This was Ostapenko's first WTA Tour-level singles title. She became the first Latvian player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament, the youngest woman to win the French Open since 1997, and the first woman since Barbara Jordan at the aforementioned 1979 Australian Open to win a Grand Slam event as her first tour-level singles title. Ostapenko was the first unseeded woman to win the French Open since 1933, as well as the lowest-ranked (47) since computer rankings began in 1975.As a result of Halep's loss in the final, Angelique Kerber retained the WTA no. 1 singles ranking even though she lost in the first round. Kerber's loss marked the first time the top women's seed had lost her first round match at the French Open in the Open Era, and the first time this had happened at any Grand Slam tournament since the 2001 Wimbledon Championships.This was the first Grand Slam tournament to feature neither Serena Williams nor Maria Sharapova since the 2002 Australian Open.
