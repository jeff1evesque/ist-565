Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico is a black and white photograph taken by Ansel Adams, late in the afternoon on November 1, 1941, from a shoulder of highway US 84 / US 285 in the unincorporated community of Hernandez, New Mexico. The approximate location where the image was taken is 36.057186°N 106.116974°W﻿ / 36.057186; -106.116974.
The photograph shows the Moon rising in a dominating black sky above a collection of modest dwellings, a church and a cross-filled graveyard, with snow-covered mountains in the background. Adams captured a single image, with the dying second of sunset lighting the white crosses and buildings.  Art historian H. W. Janson called the photograph "a perfect marriage of straight and pure photography".The photograph became so popular and collectible that Adams personally made over 1,300 photographic prints of it during his long career. The fame of the photograph grew when a 1948 print sold at auction "for the then-unheard-of price of $71,500" in 1971 ($432,100 in 2017); the same print sold for $609,600 in 2006 ($740,000 in 2017) at a Sotheby's auction.
