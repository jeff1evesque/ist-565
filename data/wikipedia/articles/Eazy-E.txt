Eric Lynn Wright (September 7, 1964 â€“ March 26, 1995), better known by his stage name Eazy-E, was an American rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur. Dubbed the "Godfather of gangsta rap", he gained extreme notoriety for his work with N.W.A, where he has been credited for pushing the boundaries of lyrical and visual content in mainstream popular music.
Born and raised in Compton, Eazy-E faced several legal troubles before founding the Ruthless Records record label in 1986. After beginning a short solo career, where he worked heavily with Ice Cube and Dr. Dre, the trio came together to form the group N.W.A later that year. As a member of the group, he released the controversial album, Straight Outta Compton (1988), which tackled many socio-political issues. The album has been regarded as one of the greatest albums of all-time, and one of the most influential in the genre. The group released their final studio album three years later, and disbanded shortly after, due to long-standing financial disputes.
Eazy-E then resumed his solo career, where he released two EPs, which drew inspiration from funk music, contemporary hip-hop, and comedians. He also engaged in a high-profile feud with Dr. Dre, before being hospitalized with AIDS in 1995. He died a month after his hospitalization.
