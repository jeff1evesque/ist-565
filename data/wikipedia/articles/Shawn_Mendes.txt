Shawn Peter Raul Mendes (; born August 8, 1998) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. He gained a following in 2013, posting song covers on the video-sharing application Vine. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager Andrew Gertler and Island Records A&R Ziggy Chareton, which led to him signing a deal with the record label.
Mendes went on to release an EP in July 2014 and his debut studio album Handwritten (2015), whose single "Stitches" reached the top 10 in the United States and Canada, and number one in the United Kingdom. His second album Illuminate (2016) was supported by the singles "Treat You Better" and "There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back", which reached the top 10 in several countries. His self-titled third studio album was released in 2018. All three albums debuted atop of the US Billboard 200, with the first one making Mendes one of five artists to ever debut at number one before the age of eighteen. Mendes has headlined three concert tours: ShawnsFirstHeadlines, Shawn Mendes World Tour and Illuminate World Tour. In 2018, Mendes was included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Mendes also became the first artist to land four number ones on the Adult Top 40 chart before age 20. Among his accolades, Mendes has won an American Music Award and three Juno Awards.
