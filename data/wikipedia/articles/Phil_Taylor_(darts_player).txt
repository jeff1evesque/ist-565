Philip Douglas Taylor (born 13 August 1960) is an English retired professional darts player, nicknamed The Power. He is widely regarded as the greatest darts player of all time, having won 216 professional tournaments, including 85 major titles and a record 16 World Championships. He won eight consecutive World Championships from 1995 to 2002 and reached 14 consecutive finals from 1994 to 2007 (both records).
He won the PDC Player of the Year award six times (2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012) and has twice been nominated for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, in 2006 and 2010, finishing as runner-up in the latter. He was the first person to hit two nine-dart finishes in one match, in the 2010 Premier League Darts final against James Wade. He hit a record 11 televised nine-dart finishes (and 22 overall).
Taylor played in competitions organised by the British Darts Organisation (BDO) until 1993. Amidst growing disenchantment with the BDO, he was among 16 top players who broke away to form their own organisation, the World Darts Council, now known as the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC).
Just before the final of the 2018 World Championship, Taylor confirmed his retirement from professional darts.
