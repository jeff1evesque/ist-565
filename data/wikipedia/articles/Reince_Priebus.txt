Reinhold Richard "Reince" Priebus ( PREE-b…ôs; born March 18, 1972) is an American lawyer and politician who served as White House chief of staff for President Donald Trump from January 20, 2017, until July 31, 2017. He also served as the chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC) from 2011 to 2017.
Raised in Wisconsin, Priebus graduated from the University of Miami School of Law in 1998. After working for the law firm Michael Best & Friedrich LLP, Priebus was elected as the chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party in 2007. In 2009, he became the general counsel for the Republican National Committee. He won the 2011 Republican National Committee chairmanship election and took office in January 2011. As chairman, Priebus was the public face of the party and frequently criticized the policies of President Barack Obama. He presided over the Republican Party during the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections.
Priebus publicly criticized Trump during the early stages of the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, but he later called for party unity. He opposed efforts to deny Trump the nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention and supported his presidential campaign in the general election. Days after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Trump announced that Priebus would serve as his first Chief of Staff. On July 28, 2017, President Trump announced that he would make Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly the chief of staff, after Priebus submitted his resignation on July 27. Priebus had the shortest tenure of any non-interim White House Chief of Staff in American history. Priebus' last day in the position was July 31 when Kelly was sworn in. Priebus drew controversy for his management style as chief of staff.
