Sharknado is a 2013 made-for-television science fiction disaster comedy film about a waterspout that lifts sharks out of the ocean and deposits them in Los Angeles. It is the first installment in the Sharknado film series. It first aired on the Syfy channel on July 11, 2013, and stars Tara Reid, Ian Ziering, and John Heard. It was also given a one-night-only special midnight theatrical screening via Regal Cinemas and NCM Fathom Events, where it earned less than $200,000 from 200 screenings. Four sequels were produced: Sharknado 2: The Second One, Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!, Sharknado: The 4th Awakens and Sharknado 5: Global Swarming. The Last Sharknado: It's About Time, the sixth and final film in the franchise, was released on August 19, 2018.
