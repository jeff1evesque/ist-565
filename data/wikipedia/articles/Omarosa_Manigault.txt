Omarose Onee Manigault Newman (; born February 5, 1974), known as Omarosa, is an American reality television show participant, writer, and former political aide to President Donald Trump. She became widely known as a contestant on the first season of NBC's reality television series The Apprentice.
After becoming assistant to the President and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison during the Trump administration in January of 2017, Newman resigned the White House on 13 December 2017.  Subsequently, she competed on Celebrity Big Brother, making it to the final five of the season.
In August 2018, Newman released Unhinged, detailing her tenure at the White House and criticizing Trump and his administration. Two days before the book was released, she released the first of as many as 200 secret tapes she recorded during her White House tenure. As of 30 August 2018, she has released four tapes. The first tape she released, which was secretly recorded inside the Situation Room, was described as "one of the worst White House security breaches ever,"  though the tape is thought not to violate the Espionage Act.
