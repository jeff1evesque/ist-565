The World's Strongest Man is a strongman competition. Organized by IMG, an Endeavor company, it is broadcast in the US during summers and in the UK around the end of December each year.  Competitors qualify based on placing in the top three at the four to eight Giants Live events each year.The current event sponsor is Coregenx, a nutritional supplement manufacturer from Irvine, California. Coregenx succeeded the previous sponsor, The Commerce Hotel and Casino. Other past sponsors include DAF Trucks, Tonka, MET-Rx, and PartyPoker.com. 
The event has a number of rival and parallel competitions with which it is sometimes confused, including the Strongman Super Series, the now defunct IFSA Strongman World Championships (run from 2005-2007 after the International Federation of Strength Athletes parted company with WSM in 2004) and Strongman Champions League.
