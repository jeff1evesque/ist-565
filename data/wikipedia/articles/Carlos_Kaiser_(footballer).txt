Carlos Henrique Raposo (born 2 April 1963), commonly known as Carlos Kaiser, is a Brazilian former footballer who played as a striker, better known as being a "farce footballer". He was selected to play with many teams in his decade-long career, but never actually played a regulation game and hid his limited ability with phony injuries, frequent team changes and other ruses.
