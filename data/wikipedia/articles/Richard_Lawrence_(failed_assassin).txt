Richard Lawrence (c. 1800 â€“ June 13, 1861) was an American house painter who was the first known person to attempt to assassinate a sitting President of the United States. Lawrence attempted to shoot President Andrew Jackson outside the United States Capitol on January 30, 1835. The attempt failed, and Jackson reputedly beat Lawrence with a cane before a crowd subdued Lawrence. Lawrence spent the remainder of his life contemplating his failed attempt in an insane asylum. He vowed to complete his task one day but never got the chance.
