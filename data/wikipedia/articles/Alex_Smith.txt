Alexander Douglas Smith (born May 7, 1984) is an American football quarterback for the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Utah Utes, where he was named the Mountain West Conference Player of the Year in 2004 and led Utah to a victory at the 2005 Fiesta Bowl, finishing in the national top-five.
Selected by the San Francisco 49ers, Smith was the first overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft. In his first six seasons, he played for a different offensive coordinator each year and struggled with injuries and consistency. Under head coach Jim Harbaugh in 2011, Smith enjoyed his strongest statistical season, leading the 49ers to their first NFC West division title and first playoff victory since 2002 — along with their first NFC Championship Game appearance since 1997. The following season, Smith sustained a concussion in the middle of the season and was replaced by Colin Kaepernick. Despite posting strong statistical numbers during the season before the injury, Smith did not regain his starting position after he was medically cleared to play.
Following the 2012 season, Smith was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs. In his first season with the team, he led them to a 9–0 start and their first playoff berth in three years. Smith went on to guide the Chiefs to an eleven-game winning streak in 2015 and their first playoff win since 1994. During his time with the Chiefs, only Tom Brady and Russell Wilson had won more games as a starting quarterback. Following the 2017 season, Smith was traded to the Redskins and subsequently signed a long-term deal with them.
