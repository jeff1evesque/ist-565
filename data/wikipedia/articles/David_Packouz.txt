David Mordechai Packouz ( born February 16, 1982) is an American former arms dealer, musician, inventor and entrepreneur.
In 2005, Packouz (23 years old at the time) joined Efraim Diveroli (19 years old at the time) in Diveroli's arms company AEY Inc. By the end of 2006, the company had won 149 contracts worth around $10.5 million. In early 2007, AEY secured a nearly $300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles, aviation rockets and other munitions. The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China, violating the terms of AEY's contract with the US Army, which bans Chinese ammunition. Packouz  was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted, and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition. As a result of the publicity surrounding the contract and the age of the arms dealers – Packouz was 25 and Diveroli was 21 when AEY landed the ammunition deal – the United States Army began a review of its contracting procedures.Packouz was sentenced to seven months of house arrest for conspiracy to defraud the United States. He is the central subject of the Todd Phillips dramedy film War Dogs in 2016. Packouz himself has a cameo role in the film as a guitarist and singer at an elderly home.
Packouz went on to invent a guitar pedal drum machine, the BeatBuddy, and is currently the CEO of music technology company Singular Sound.
