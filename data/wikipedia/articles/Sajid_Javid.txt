Sajid Javid (born 5 December 1969) is a British politician of the Conservative Party and former managing director at Deutsche Bank. He was appointed Home Secretary in April 2018. He has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bromsgrove in Worcestershire since 2010.
Born in Rochdale, Lancashire, Javid studied Economics and Politics at the University of Exeter where he joined the Conservative Party. Working in banking, he rose quickly to become a managing director at Deutsche Bank.  He was elected as the MP for Bromsgrove in 2010 and was promoted to Economic Secretary to the Treasury and later Financial Secretary to the Treasury. 
He served in the Cabinet as Culture Secretary from 2014-15, Business Secretary and President of the Board of Trade from 2015-16 and Communities Secretary from 2016-18. He was appointed to his current role as Home Secretary in April 2018 following the resignation of Amber Rudd for misleading the Home Affairs Select Committee over targets for removal of illegal immigrants during the Windrush scandal. As Home Secretary, Javid took a more liberal approach to immigration than previously, lifting the immigration cap for NHS doctors and nurses and softening the “hostile environment” policy.
