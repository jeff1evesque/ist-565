The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Jeux olympiques d'été de 2024), officially known as the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad, (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe Olympiade) and commonly known as Paris 2024, is a forthcoming international multi-sport event that is scheduled to take place from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in Paris, France.Having previously hosted both the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics, Paris will become only the second city to host the Olympic Games three times, after London (1908, 1948 and 2012). The 2024 Games also mark the centennial of the 1924 Games, which were the last Summer Olympics to be held in Paris. They will be the sixth overall Olympic Games held in France (including summer and winter Games).
Bidding to host these Games began in 2015 with five candidate cities in contention, but Hamburg, Rome and Budapest withdrew, leaving Paris and Los Angeles as the only two candidates remaining. A proposal to elect the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities at the same time was approved by an Extraordinary IOC Session on 11 July 2017 in Lausanne. On 31 July 2017, the IOC made a deal with Los Angeles to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, making Paris the host of the 2024 Summer Olympics. The formal announcement of the hosts for both Olympiads took place at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017.
