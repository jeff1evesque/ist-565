Suits is an American television drama series created by Aaron Korsh, which premiered on June 23, 2011 on the USA Network. It revolves around Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) and Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), two lawyers at a high-profile New York corporate law firm. Harvey is one of the city's top attorneys. He chooses to take on Mike as his associate, although Mike never attended Harvard—the only school from which the firm hires—or indeed any law school at all. Ross relies on his photographic memory and intelligence to succeed.
The series was renewed for an eighth season on January 30, 2018. As of  August 22, 2018, 114 episodes of Suits have aired.
