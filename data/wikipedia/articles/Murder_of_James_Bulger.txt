James Patrick Bulger (16 March 1990 â€“ 12 February 1993) was a boy from Kirkby, Merseyside, England, who was murdered on 12 February 1993, at the age of two. He was abducted, tortured and killed by two ten-year-old boys, Robert Thompson (born 23 August 1982) and Jon Venables (born 13 August 1982). Bulger was led away from the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle whilst his mother took her eyes off him momentarily. His mutilated body was found on a railway line 2.5 miles (4 km) away in Walton, Liverpool, two days after his murder. Thompson and Venables were charged on 20 February 1993 with Bulger's abduction and murder.
They were found guilty on 24 November 1993, making them the youngest convicted murderers in modern English history. They were sentenced to detention during Her Majesty's pleasure until a Parole Board decision in June 2001 recommended their release on a lifelong licence aged 18. In 2010, Venables was recalled to prison for breaching the terms of his licence, and was released on parole again in 2013. In November 2017, Venables was again sent to prison for breaching his licence by possessing child abuse images on his computer.
The Bulger case has prompted widespread debate on the issue of how to handle young offenders when they are sentenced or released from custody.
