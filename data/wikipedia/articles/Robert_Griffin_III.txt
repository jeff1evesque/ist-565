Robert Lee Griffin III (born February 12, 1990), nicknamed RG3 or RGIII, is an American football quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Baylor, where he won the 2011 Heisman Trophy. He was drafted by the Washington Redskins second overall in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft, who traded up to get him.
Griffin had a successful rookie season with the Redskins, setting records for the highest passer rating and highest touchdown to interception ratio by a rookie quarterback, and leading the Redskins to the top of their division and their first playoff appearance in five seasons. He won the 2012 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award and although unable to participate due to a knee injury he suffered late in the season, was named to enter the 2013 Pro Bowl. However, Griffin was less successful during his subsequent tenure with the Redskins as he was plagued by injuries and poor performance.
After suffering a concussion during the 2015 preseason, Griffin was replaced by Kirk Cousins who played the rest of the season. He was released by the team following the end of the season, and signed shortly after with the Cleveland Browns. His tenure with the Browns was also plagued with injuries, and he was subsequently released after one season. After spending the entire 2017 season as a free agent, Griffin signed a one-year deal with the Ravens in 2018.
