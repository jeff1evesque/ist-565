Donald Trump's usage of social media has attracted worldwide attention. The main coverage has been about his tweets regarding various subjects since he joined social networking site Twitter in March 2009. Trump has frequently used Twitter and other social media platforms to make comments about other politicians, celebrities and daily news. He relied on Twitter significantly to communicate during the 2016 United States presidential campaign. The attention on Trump's Twitter activity has significantly increased since he was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States and has continued to post controversial or false opinions and statements.Then-White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said during his tenure that Trump's "tweets" are "considered official statements by the President of the United States". According to a June 2017 Fox News poll, 70 percent of respondents said Trump's tweets were hurting his agenda and 17 percent said the tweets were helpful.
