The Loyola Ramblers men's basketball team represents Loyola University Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. The Ramblers joined the Missouri Valley Conference on July 1, 2013, ending a 34-season tenure as charter members of the Horizon League.In 1963, Loyola won the 1963 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament (then the "NCAA University Division") men's basketball national championship under the leadership of All-American Jerry Harkness, defeating two-time defending champion Cincinnati 60â€“58 in overtime in the title game. All five starters for the Ramblers played the entire championship game without substitution. 
Surviving team members were honored on July 11, 2013, at the White House to commemorate the 50th anniversary of their victory. The entire team was inducted in November of that year in the College Basketball Hall of Fame. As of 2018, Loyola remains the only school from the state of Illinois to win a men's Division I basketball NCAA tournament. Loyola's first-round regional victory over Tennessee Tech on March 11, 1963, remains a record for margin of victory (69 points) for any NCAA men's basketball tournament game.
