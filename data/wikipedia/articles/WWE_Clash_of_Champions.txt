WWE Clash of Champions was a professional wrestling event produced annually by WWE, a Connecticutâ€“based professional wrestling promotion, and broadcast live and available only through pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network. The event was established in 2016 for Raw brand, replacing WWE Night of Champions in the late September slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar. However, the 2017 edition of the event was held on the December slot, and became a SmackDown-branded event. In 2018, it was announced that Clash of Champions would be a dual branded event, but it was later canceled.
