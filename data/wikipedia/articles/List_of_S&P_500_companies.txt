The S&P 500 stock market index, maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, comprises 505 common stocks issued by 500 large-cap companies and traded on American stock exchanges, and covers about 80 percent of the American equity market by capitalization. The index is weighted by free-float market capitalization, so more valuable companies account for relatively more of the index. The index constituents and the constituent weights are updated regularly using rules published by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Although the index is called the S&P "500", the index contains 505 stocks because it includes two share classes of stock from 5 of its component companies.
