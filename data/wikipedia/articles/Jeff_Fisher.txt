Jeffrey Michael Fisher (born February 25, 1958) is a former American football coach and player. He served as a head coach in the National Football League (NFL) for 22 seasons, primarily with the Tennessee Titans franchise. He coached the Titans for 17 seasons and the St Louis/Los Angeles Rams for five seasons.
Fisher became the coach of the Titans towards the end of the 1994 season during their tenure as the Houston Oilers and was the team's first coach when they relocated to Tennessee. He continued to coach the Titans until after the end of the 2010 season, when he was fired. Following a season away from football, Fisher was hired as the head coach of the Rams in 2012 and coached the team during their last four years in St. Louis. He remained the head coach of the Rams during the franchise's return to Los Angeles in 2016, but was fired near the end of the season.Fisher's most successful season was in 1999, when he led the Titans to the franchise's first (and only) Super Bowl appearance in XXXIV, which ended in close defeat. However, despite compiling a winning record as a head coach, Fisher's career has been noted for an overall lack of success, having only obtained six winning seasons and postseason appearances in over two decades in the NFL. He holds the record for the most regular season losses by an NFL head coach at 165, tied with Dan Reeves.
