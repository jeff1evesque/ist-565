The Man with No Name (Italian: Uomo senza nome) is the protagonist portrayed by Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's "Dollars Trilogy" of Spaghetti Western films: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). He is easily recognizable due to his iconic poncho, brown hat, tan cowboy boots, fondness for cigarillos and the fact that he rarely talks. Since he never received an official name in any of the films, he is conventionally known as "the man with no name". When Clint Eastwood was honored with the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996, Jim Carrey held the introductory speech and said: "'The Man With No Name' had no name, so we could fill in our own." In 2008, Empire chose the Man With No Name as the 33rd greatest movie character of all time.
