The Standing Liberty quarter is a 25-cent coin that was struck by the United States Mint from 1916 to 1930.  It succeeded the Barber quarter, which had been minted since 1892.  Featuring the goddess of Liberty on one side and an eagle in flight on the other, the coin was designed by sculptor Hermon Atkins MacNeil.
In 1915, Director of the Mint Robert W. Woolley set in motion efforts to replace the Barber dime, quarter, and half dollar, as he mistakenly believed that the law required new designs.  MacNeil submitted a militaristic design that showed Liberty on guard against attacks.  The Mint required modifications to the initial design, and MacNeil's revised version included dolphins to represent the oceans.  In late 1916, Mint officials made major changes to the design without consulting MacNeil.  The sculptor complained about the changes after receiving the new issue in January 1917.  The Mint obtained special legislation to allow MacNeil to redesign the coin as he desired.  One change made by the sculptor was the addition of a chain mail vest that covered Liberty's formerly bare breast.
In circulation, the coin's date wore away quickly, and Mint engravers modified the design to address the issue in 1925.  The Standing Liberty quarter was discontinued in 1931, a year in which no quarters were struck.  By Congressional act the Washington quarter, featuring the first president's profile was introduced in 1932 to celebrate the bicentennial of his birth.
