It was the 120th annual Grand Final of the Australian Football League (formerly the Victorian Football League), staged to determine the premiers of the 2016 AFL season. It was the Swans' fifth grand final appearance since 2005, while the Bulldogs were competing in their first grand final since 1961. The match, played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in front of 99,981 spectators, was won by the Bulldogs by a margin of 22 points, marking their second VFL/AFL premiership victory and first since 1954, breaking a 62-year premiership drought.
