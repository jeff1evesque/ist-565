Gilbert Baker (June 2, 1951 â€“ March 31, 2017) was an American artist, gay rights activist, and designer of the rainbow flag (1978). 
Baker's flag became widely associated with LGBT rights causes, a symbol of gay pride that has become ubiquitous in the decades since its debut. California state senator Scott Wiener said Baker "helped define the modern LGBT movement".
In 2015, the Museum of Modern Art ranked the rainbow flag as an internationally recognized symbol as important as the recycling symbol.
