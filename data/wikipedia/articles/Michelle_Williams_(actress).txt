Born to the politician and trader Larry R. Williams, Williams was raised in Kalispell, Montana, and San Diego, California. She began her career at a young age with television guest appearances and made her feature film debut in Lassie (1994). At 15, she was granted emancipation from her parents, and shortly afterwards rose to fame for playing Jen Lindley in the television series Dawson's Creek (1998â€“2003). Williams followed this with appearances in several low-budget films, before achieving her breakthrough with a supporting role in Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005), for which she received her first Oscar nomination.
Williams went on to earn critical acclaim for playing emotionally troubled women coping with loss or loneliness in the independent dramas Wendy and Lucy (2008), Blue Valentine (2010), and Manchester by the Sea (2016). For portraying Marilyn Monroe in My Week with Marilyn (2011), she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Williams' highest-grossing releases came with the thriller Shutter Island (2010), the fantasy film Oz the Great and Powerful (2013), and the musical The Greatest Showman (2017). On Broadway, Williams starred in revivals of the musical Cabaret in 2014 and the drama Blackbird in 2016. For playing a sexually abused woman in the latter, she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.
Despite significant media attention, Williams is reticent about her personal life. She was in a relationship with the actor Heath Ledger for three years, with whom she has a daughter, and she married the musician Phil Elverum in 2018.
