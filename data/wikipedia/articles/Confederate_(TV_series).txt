Confederate is a planned American television and alternate history drama series set in a timeline where the American Civil War ended in a stalemate. David Benioff and D. B. Weiss are developing the series for the network HBO. The two previously developed the HBO series Game of Thrones. The announcement of Confederate was followed by anger and criticism on social media with some describing it as "slavery fan fiction", leading to the hashtag #NoConfederate, which trended number one in the United States and number two worldwide on Twitter.
