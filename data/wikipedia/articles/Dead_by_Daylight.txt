Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric survival horror game developed by Behaviour Interactive and published by Starbreeze Studios. Dead by Daylight was released for the Microsoft Windows operating system in June 2016, and released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One home consoles in June 2017. The game is played exclusively as a one versus four (1 v. 4) online multiplayer where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured, and killed.
Among a handful of original characters, the game also includes unlockable and downloadable (DLC) characters. Characters from horror franchises such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween and Saw are featured.
A spiritual successor, Identity V, developed by NetEase and co-developed by Behavior Interactive, was released for mobiles in China in early 2018, and was released worldwide on July 2018.
