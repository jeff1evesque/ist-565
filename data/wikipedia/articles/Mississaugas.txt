The Mississauga are a subtribe of the Anishinaabe-speaking First Nations people located in southern Ontario, Canada.  They are closely related to the Ojibwe. The name "Mississauga" comes from the Anishinaabe word Misi-zaagiing, meaning "[Those at the] Great River-mouth." It closely related to the Ojibwe word Misswezahging, which means ‘a river with many outlets.’
