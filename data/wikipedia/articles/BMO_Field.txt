BMO Field is an outdoor stadium located at Exhibition Place in Toronto, Ontario, Canada which is home to Toronto FC of Major League Soccer, the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, and Toronto FC II of the United Soccer League. Constructed on the site of the former Exhibition Stadium and first opened in 2007, it is owned by the City of Toronto, and managed by Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment. The stadium's naming rights are held by the Bank of Montreal, which is commonly branded as "BMO" ().
BMO Field was originally constructed as a soccer-specific stadium to serve as the home field of the expansion Toronto FC, and hosted matches during the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup and 2014 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. In 2010, it hosted the MLS Cup final (then a neutral-site game), and the 2016 final and 2017 final featuring Toronto FC (who hosted because they were the highest remaining seed). The venue has also hosted rugby union, including matches of Canada's national team, and rugby sevens during the 2015 Pan-American Games.
From 2014 to 2016, the stadium underwent a series of major renovations, which added an upper deck to the east grandstand, a roof over the seating areas and lengthened the field to make it suitable for hosting Canadian football. The latter allowed for the Toronto Argonauts to move to BMO Field beginning with the 2016 CFL season, which also saw the 104th Grey Cup played at the stadium.
