The Conjuring is a shared universe of American horror film series mainly produced by New Line Cinema, The Safran Company and Atomic Monster Productions, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. The films present a dramatized take on the real-life cases of Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators and authors associated with prominent yet controversial cases of haunting. The main series follows their attempts to assist people who find themselves possessed by demonic spirits, while the spin-off films focus on the origins of some of the entities the Warrens have encountered.
James Wan explained that the idea for a shared universe of horror films, was a collective decision by those involved with the films, comparing it to other franchises stating, "It occurred to us early on that they have a superhero universe, why can't we do it in the horror world?"
