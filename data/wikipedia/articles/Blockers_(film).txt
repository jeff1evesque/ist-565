Blockers is a 2018 American sex comedy film directed by Kay Cannon (in her directorial debut) and written by Brian Kehoe and Jim Kehoe. The film stars Leslie Mann, Ike Barinholtz, and John Cena as a trio of parents who try to stop their daughters (Kathryn Newton, Geraldine Viswanathan, and Gideon Adlon) from losing their virginity on prom night. The film's title and posters are a reference to the act of "cockblocking"; the rooster icon was removed for advertising on broadcast television and cable networks that objected, with only the Blockers text being shown.
The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018 and was theatrically released in the United States on April 6, 2018, by Universal Pictures. It grossed $93 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its "humor and performances", as well as for "intelligence and empathy" not often found in the genre.
