A joint session of the United States Congress is a gathering of members of the two chambers of the bicameral legislature of the federal government of the United States: the Senate and the House of Representatives. Joint sessions can be held on any special occasion, but are required to be held when the President delivers a State of the Union address, when they gather to count and certify the votes of the Electoral College following a presidential election, or when they convene on the occasion of a presidential inauguration. A joint session is a ceremonial or formal occasion and does not perform any legislative function; and no resolution is proposed or vote taken.
Joint sessions and meetings are usually held in the Chamber of the House of Representatives, and are traditionally presided over by the Speaker of the House. However, the Constitution requires the Vice President (as President of the Senate) to preside over the counting of electoral votes.
