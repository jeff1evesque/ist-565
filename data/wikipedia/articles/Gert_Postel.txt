Gert Postel (born June 18, 1958 in Bremen) is a German impostor, best known for successfully applying as a medical doctor several times without ever having received medical education.
Gert Postel went to Hauptschule and finished his training as a mail carrier. Postel himself said that his mother died because of a maladministered depression treatment and that he himself had briefly been in a juvenile ward. From these events, he claimed to have gained the motivation to expose and embarrass psychiatry.
