The film was released in the United States by Universal Pictures on July 13, 2018, in 2D and Real D 3D, and has grossed over $293 million worldwide against its production budget of around $125 million. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Johnson's performance and the film's suspenseful scenes, but criticized the script as clichéd and too similar to The Towering Inferno and Die Hard.
