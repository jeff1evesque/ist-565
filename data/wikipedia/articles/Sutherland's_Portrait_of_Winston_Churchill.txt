In 1954 the English artist Graham Sutherland was commissioned to paint a full-length portrait of Sir Winston Churchill. The 1,000 guinea fee for the painting was funded by donations from members of the House of Commons and House of Lords. The painting was presented to Churchill by both Houses of Parliament at a public ceremony in Westminster Hall on his 80th birthday on 30 November 1954.Churchill hated the portrait.  After the public presentation, the painting was taken to his country home at Chartwell but was not put on display.  After the death of Lady Churchill in 1977, it became clear that she had  the painting destroyed some months after it was delivered.
