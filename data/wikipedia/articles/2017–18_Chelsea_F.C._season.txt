The 2017â€“18 season was Chelsea's 104th competitive season, 29th consecutive season in the top flight of English football, 26th consecutive season in the Premier League, and 112th year in existence as a football club. The season covered the period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018.
The season was the first without club legend John Terry after he departed on a free transfer following 22 years with the club. Chelsea returned to the UEFA Champions League after a single season's absence, and entered the Premier League season as defending champions. The season was also Chelsea's first under the new kit deal with Nike, the most lucrative commercial deal in the history of the club.
