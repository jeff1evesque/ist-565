Trevor Rees-Jones (also known as Trevor Rees; born 3 March 1968) is a German-born British bodyguard who was badly injured in the car crash in Paris that killed Diana, Princess of Wales on 31 August 1997. Because he suffered a serious head injury, Rees-Jones does not recall many details.
Early media reports claimed he survived because he was wearing a seat belt, but a December 2006 Operation Paget technical examination said that none of the occupants of the car were wearing their seat belt.
