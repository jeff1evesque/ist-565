Saroo Brierley (born 1981) is an Indian-born Australian businessman and author who, at age five, was accidentally separated from his biological mother. He was adopted by an Australian couple and, 25 years later, reunited with his biological mother. His story generated significant international media attention, especially in Australia and India.
An autobiographical account of his experiences, A Long Way Home, was published in 2013 in Australia, released internationally in 2014, and adapted into the 2016 film Lion, starring Dev Patel as Saroo and Nicole Kidman as his adoptive mother, Sue Brierley.
