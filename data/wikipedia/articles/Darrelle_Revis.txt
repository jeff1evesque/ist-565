Darrelle Shavar Revis (born July 14, 1985) is a former American football cornerback. He played college football for the University of Pittsburgh and was drafted in the first round (14th overall) by the New York Jets in the 2007 NFL Draft. He also played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Kansas City Chiefs and New England Patriots. With the Patriots, he won Super Bowl XLIX over the Seattle Seahawks.
His spot on the field was nicknamed "Revis Island," a phrase Revis trademarked, for his ability to shut down the opposing number one receiver. By 2010, he was considered one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL.
