The Lion King is an upcoming American musical drama film directed and produced by Jon Favreau, produced by Walt Disney Pictures, and written by Jeff Nathanson. It is a remake of Disney's 1994 animated film of the same name. The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Beyonc√©, James Earl Jones (who reprises his role from the original film), Chiwetel Ejiofor, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, John Kani, John Oliver, and Alfre Woodard. 
Plans for a Lion King remake were confirmed in September 2016 following the success of Favreau's Jungle Book adaptation.  Much of the main cast signed on in early-2017 and principal photography began that summer on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The film is scheduled to be released on July 19, 2019.
