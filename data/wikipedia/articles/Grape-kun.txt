Grape-kun (Japanese: グレープ君, Hepburn: Gurēpu-kun) (April 16, 1996 – October 12, 2017) was a Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti) at Tobu Zoo located in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. His attachment to a cutout of a character from the 2017 anime series Kemono Friends earned him international fame. Grape-kun began to have health issues in early October 2017, and the zoo announced his death on October 12.
