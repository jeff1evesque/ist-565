Saw 3D (also known as Saw: The Final Chapter) is a 2010 American 3D horror film directed by Kevin Greutert, written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, and starring Tobin Bell, Costas Mandylor, Betsy Russell, Sean Patrick Flanery and Cary Elwes. It is the seventh (and originally intended final) installment of the Saw franchise, and the only film in the series to be in 3D.
The film focuses on a man who falsely claims to be a Jigsaw survivor, becoming a local celebrity. However, he soon finds himself part of a real Jigsaw game where he must ultimately save his wife. Meanwhile, Jill Tuck reveals to an internal affairs officer that rogue Detective Mark Hoffman is the man responsible for the recent Jigsaw games, and Hoffman hunts her down.
An eighth installment was planned, but the decrease in the box office performance for Saw VI compared to previous installments led to Saw 3D being the final planned film in the series, and the plot concept for Saw VIII being incorporated into Saw 3D. Saw V director David Hackl was to direct the film, but two weeks before filming Lionsgate announced that Greutert, who directed the sixth film, would direct. Principal photography took place in Toronto, Ontario from February to April 2010 and was shot with the SI-3D digital camera system, as opposed to shooting with traditional cameras and later transferring to 3D in post-production.
Saw 3D was originally scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada on October 22, 2010, but was pushed back a week from its original release date of October 22, 2010, to October 29, 2010; it was released a day earlier in the United Kingdom and Australia. Saw 3D opened at number one making over $22.5 million. It was eventually followed by an eighth film, Jigsaw, in 2017.
