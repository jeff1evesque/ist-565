Charles Joseph John Hart (born 19 April 1987) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Burnley and the English national team. With over 100 Premier League clean sheets, Hart holds the joint record for the most Premier League Golden Glove awards (four) and has amassed 75 international caps since his debut in 2008.
He began his career at his hometown club Shrewsbury Town in the Football Conference and League Two. In 2006, he moved to top-flight Manchester City, having attracted the attention of several Premier League teams. He spent time on loan at Tranmere Rovers and Blackpool in his first season, before spending the 2009–10 season at Birmingham City. Hart was nominated for the PFA Young Player of the Year and was voted as the Premier League goalkeeper of the 2009–10 season in recognition of his performances at Birmingham. He returned to Manchester City for the 2010–11 season and won the Golden Glove for keeping the most clean sheets throughout the Premier League season. Hart replicated this feat in the 2011–12 season and was a key player during City's title-winning campaign. He won the Golden Glove for the third year in a row in the following season, and earned a second Premier League title in 2014. In 2015, Hart once again won the Golden Glove award for the fourth time in five years. With the arrival of Pep Guardiola in 2016, Hart was dropped for selection by the new manager and made only one appearance in the Champions League before moving on loan to Torino and West Ham United in successive seasons. He then signed a permanent transfer to Burnley after having being told he had no first team future with City.
A former regular for England at Under-21 level, Hart made his senior international debut in June 2008, and was recognised as England's first-choice goalkeeper from 2010 to 2017. He has gained over 70 caps and was selected in England's squads for two FIFA World Cups and as many UEFA European Championships.
