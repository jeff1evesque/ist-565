Kölsch (German pronunciation: [kœlʃ]) is a beer brewed in Cologne, Germany. It is a clear, top-fermented beer with a bright, straw-yellow hue similar to other beers brewed from mainly Pilsener malt.
Kölsch is warm fermented at around 13 to 21 °C (55 to 70 °F), then conditioned by lagering at cold temperatures. This style of fermentation links Kölsch with some other central northern European beers such as the Altbiers of western Germany and the Netherlands.
Kölsch is defined by an agreement between members of the Cologne Brewery Association known as the Kölsch Konvention. It has a gravity between 11 and 16 degrees Plato (specific gravity 1.044 to 1.065).
