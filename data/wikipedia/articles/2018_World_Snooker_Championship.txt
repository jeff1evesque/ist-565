The 2018 World Snooker Championship (also referred to as the 2018 Betfred World Snooker Championship for the purposes of sponsorship) was a professional snooker tournament, held from 21 April to 7 May 2018 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. It was the 42nd consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible and was the twentieth and final ranking event of the 2017/2018 season. The tournament was broadcast in Europe by the BBC and Eurosport.
Mark Williams won his third world title and 21st ranking title by beating John Higgins 18–16 in the final. The win came 15 years after Williams' second world title in 2003 and he became, at the age of 43, the second oldest winner at the Crucible. Three-time world champion Mark Selby had won the title for the previous two years but lost in the first round 4–10 to Joe Perry.
