The Algiers Motel Killings occurred in Detroit, Michigan, United States, during the night of July 25â€“26, 1967 during the racially charged 12th Street Riot. At the Algiers Motel, approximately one mile east of where the riots began, three teenage civilians, all of them black, were beaten and killed by police.  Nine others, two white females and seven black males, were badly beaten and humiliated by members of a riot task force composed of the Detroit Police Department, the Michigan State Police, and the Michigan Army National Guard.  The killings occurred after reports were received that snipers, a gunman, or group of gunmen had been seen at or near the motel. One death has never been explained as the body was allegedly found by responding officers.  Two deaths have been attributed to "justifiable homicide" or "self-defense". Charges of felonious assault, conspiracy, murder, and conspiracy to commit civil rights abuse were filed against three officers. Charges of assault and conspiracy were also filed on a private security guard. All were found not guilty.
