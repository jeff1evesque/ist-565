3% is a Brazilian dystopian thriller web television series created by Pedro Aguilera, starring Jo√£o Miguel and Bianca Comparato. Developed from a 2009 independent pilot episode, it is the first Portuguese-language Netflix original series and the second non-English production, after the Spanish-language series Club de Cuervos.
The series is set in an unspecified future when 20-year-old individuals of the impoverished "Inland" have the single opportunity to complete "The Process" and advance to the affluence of the distant "Offshore" society. While most of the unsuccessful candidates are simply eliminated, some fail to survive, leading to only 3% of the candidates succeeding.The first season, consisting of 8 episodes, became available on Netflix worldwide on November 25, 2016. In December 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, which consists of 10 episodes and was released on April 27, 2018. On June 4, 2018, the series was renewed for a third season, which is scheduled to be released in 2019.
