3% is a Brazilian dystopian thriller web television series created by Pedro Aguilera, starring Jo√£o Miguel and Bianca Comparato. Developed from a 2009 independent pilot episode, it is the first Portuguese-language Netflix original series and the second non-English production, after the Spanish-language series Club de Cuervos.
The series is set in an unspecified future when the squalor of a breeding population is given a single chance to advance to the "better side" of society affording privilege, technological superiority and affluence in the distant "Offshore", else abandoned to the continued depravation and poverty of the "Inland". Candidates for the much lauded "Process" of application must be 20 years of age with only 3% of the candidates succeeding. Most of the unsuccessful candidates are simply "eliminated" and are returned to their previous life of struggle, whilst some who partake in the "Process" fail to survive. The first season, consisting of 8 episodes, became available on Netflix worldwide on November 25, 2016. In December 2016, Netflix renewed the series for a second season, which was released on April 27, 2018. On June 4, 2018, the series was renewed for a third season, which is scheduled to be released in 2019.
