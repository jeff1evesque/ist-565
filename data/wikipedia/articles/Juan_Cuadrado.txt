Juan Guillermo Cuadrado Bello (locally [ˈhwaŋ ɡiˈʝeɾmo kwaˈðɾaðo]; born 26 May 1988) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Italian club Juventus and the Colombia national team. He is known for his direct style of play, including his pace (both on and off the ball) as well as his dribbling skills. He started off in a central midfield role, acting as a defensive midfielder early in his career, before being moved into wider positions in which he now usually plays, often operating as a right-sided winger, attacking midfielder, or wing-back.Having begun his career at Independiente Medellín, Cuadrado moved to Italy in 2009 to join Udinese. Used sparingly at the club, he was loaned to Lecce for the 2011–12 season, where despite relegation from Serie A, his performances earned a transfer to Fiorentina. In February 2015, he was signed by Chelsea, but after playing sparingly, was loaned to Juventus, where he won the Serie A title and the Coppa Italia.
Cuadrado made his senior international debut in 2010, and has since earned over 60 caps. He was part of the Colombian squads which reached the quarter-finals at two Copa América tournaments (2011 and 2015) and the 2014 FIFA World Cup, also contributing to his nation's third-place finish at the Copa América Centenario. He also took part at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
