YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. Since its establishment in 2005, the website has featured a "most viewed" section, which lists the most viewed videos on the site. Although the most viewed videos were initially viral videos, such as Evolution of Dance and Charlie Bit My Finger, the most viewed videos were increasingly related to music videos. In fact, since Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance", every video that has reached the top of the "most viewed YouTube videos" list has been a music video. Although the most viewed videos are no longer listed on the site, reaching the top of the list is still considered a tremendous feat.
In November 2005, a Nike advertisement featuring Brazilian soccer star Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million views. In December 2012, "Gangnam Style" became the first video to reach one billion views. By June 2015, only "Baby" had managed to reach this threshold, but by October 2015, a total of ten videos had done so. The number of billion-views videos reached 100 in February 2018, and in July 2018, "November Rain" by Guns N' Roses became the first video created before the YouTube era to reach this threshold.In May 2014 "Gangnam Style" became the first video to exceed two billion views. "Despacito" became the first video to reach three billion views in August 2017, and since has surpassed four billion in October 2017, and five billion in April 2018. As of  August 2018, 23 videos have exceeded two billion views; six of which exceed three billion views and one of which exceeds five billion views. "See You Again" became the second video to reach three billion views in August 2017, followed by "Gangnam Style" in November 2017.As of  August 2018, the fastest videos to reach the one billion view mark are "Hello" (87 days), "Despacito" (96 days), "Shape of You" (97 days), "Mi Gente" (103 days) and "Ã‰chame la Culpa" (111 days).The fastest videos to reach two billion views are "Despacito" (154 days), "Shape of You" (187 days) and "Chantaje" (379 days), and the fastest videos to reach three billion views are "Despacito" (203 days), "Shape of You" (342 days) and "See You Again" (852 days).As of  August 2018, Justin Bieber is the only artist to have five videos exceeding one billion views, while Katy Perry, Bruno Mars and Nicky Jam have four.
