Love Island (originally Celebrity Love Island) is a British reality television programme that was aired on  ITV. In the show, twelve single celebrities spent five weeks on an island in Fiji. It was originally presented by Patrick Kielty and Kelly Brook, with Fearne Cotton taking over as female host in the second series. The first series aired in the summer of 2005, and it was won by Jayne Middlemiss and Fran Cosgrave. The second series began in July 2006, dropping Celebrity from its name. It was won by Bianca Gascoigne and Calum Best.
The theme tune for the first series was "Wish I", performed by Jem. A specially-composed summer theme by Daniel Pemberton (later released under the title "From Fiji with Love") was used for the second series.
The show was axed in November 2006. On 13 February 2015, it was announced that Love Island would return on ITV2 in 2015. It was later announced that Caroline Flack would host the revived series, starting on 7 June 2015.
