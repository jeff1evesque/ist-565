Former American President George W. Bush is widely known to use nicknames to refer to journalists, fellow politicians, and members of his White House staff.  
Bush's nicknaming proclivity is noted enough to have attracted a variety of satire, including a New York Times humor piece and a Doonesbury strip where "Condi" is admonished with the phrase "Careful, Brown Sugar".
