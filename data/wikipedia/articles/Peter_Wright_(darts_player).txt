Peter Wright (born 10 March 1970) is a Scottish darts player who plays in PDC tournaments. Wright was the runner-up in the 2014 PDC World Darts Championship and is the 2017 UK Open champion. He currently resides in Mendham, Suffolk, England, and although he was largely brought up in England, he chooses to represent the country of his birth.
He is known for his mohawk hairstyle which changes colour each tournament and is made by his wife who is a hairdresser. His nickname is derived from the name of his favourite drink, the Snakebite.
