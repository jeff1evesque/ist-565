Rocastle also played for the England national football team, in all earning 14 international caps for the Three Lions.Arsène Wenger, who became Arsenal manager four years after Rocastle left the club, has described him as a " a modern player, because the revolution of the game has gone on to more technique, and more skill" and as having an "exceptional dimension as a footballer".
