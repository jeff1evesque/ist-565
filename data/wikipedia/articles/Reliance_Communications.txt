Reliance Communications (stylised as RCom) is a telecommunication company headquartered in Navi Mumbai, India. A subsidiary of Reliance Group, its services include GSM (voice; 2G, 3G and 4G), fixed-line broadband and voice, and direct-to-home satellite television (depending upon area in India). The company ended its 2G and 3G service (including all voice service), offering only 4G data service, on 29 December 2017 as a result of debt and a failed merger with Aircel.In November 2017, the company closed its wireless business. The following month, it agreed to sell its wireless assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm in an all-cash deal estimated at Rs 24,000 crore (Rs 240 billion). This would help pare its debt, which is about Rs 45,000 crore (Rs 450 billion).
