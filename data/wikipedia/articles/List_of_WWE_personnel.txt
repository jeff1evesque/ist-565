WWE is a professional wrestling promotion based in Stamford, Connecticut. WWE personnel consists of professional wrestlers, managers, play-by-play and color commentators, ring announcers, interviewers, referees, trainers, producers, script writers, and various other positions. Executives and board members are also listed.
WWE contracts typically range from developmental contracts to multi-year deals. WWE describes most personnel as "independent contractors." Since the reintroduction of WWE's brand extension in 2016, personnel on the main roster are assigned to either the Raw brand or the SmackDown brand. Main roster personnel primarily appear on Monday Night Raw, SmackDown Live, and 205 Live,  while they can also appear on WWE's other weekly television programming,  as well as pay-per-views, and on untelevised live events. 205 Live is a weekly program exclusive to cruiserweight competitors (205 lbs and under). Personnel assigned to the Raw brand may also appear on Main Event, a Raw brand-exclusive show.
Wrestlers not on the main roster appear on the NXT and NXT UK brands and appear on WWE NXT and NXT UK respectively. Wrestlers recruited to WWE's developmental system are assigned to train at the Performance Center.
