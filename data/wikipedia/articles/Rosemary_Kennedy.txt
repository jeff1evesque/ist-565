Rose Marie "Rosemary" Kennedy (September 13, 1918 â€“ January 7, 2005) was the oldest daughter born to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, and was a sister of President John F. Kennedy, and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy.
Rosemary experienced mental disabilities, and displayed less academic and sporting potential than her siblings; however, her disabilities were carefully concealed from the public by her prominent family. In her early young adult years, she also had behavioral problems. Her father arranged one of the first prefrontal lobotomies for her at the age of 23, but it failed and left her permanently incapacitated. Rosemary spent the rest of her life in an institution in Jefferson, Wisconsin, with limited contact with her family. Her condition may have inspired her sister, Eunice, to initiate the Special Olympics in 1962.
