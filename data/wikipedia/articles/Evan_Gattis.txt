James Evan Gattis (born August 18, 1986) is an American professional baseball designated hitter and catcher for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut with the Atlanta Braves on April 3, 2013. Gattis has also earned the nickname of "El Oso Blanco" or The White Bear, due to his raw power capabilities when playing for the Venezuelan Winter league. While with Atlanta, he played catcher and occasionally left field.
Gattis was a premier amateur baseball player in the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth area through high school. However, anxiety and substance abuse led him to abandon his scholarship to Texas A&M University. After wandering around the Western United States for four years, he returned to baseball, and was drafted by the Braves in 2010.
After playing in minor league baseball for the Braves, Gattis made the team's Opening Day roster in 2013. Receiving playing time with Brian McCann on the disabled list, Gattis won the National League Rookie of the Month Award for both April and May 2013. He became the Braves' primary catcher in 2014, but was traded to the Astros before the 2015 season.
