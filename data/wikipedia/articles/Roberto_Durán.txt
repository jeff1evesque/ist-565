Roberto Durán Samaniego (born June 16, 1951) is a Panamanian former professional boxer who competed from 1968 to 2001. He is a four-weight world champion, having held titles at lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight, and middleweight; as well as reigns as the undisputed and lineal lightweight champion, and the lineal welterweight champion. He is also the second boxer to have competed over a span of five decades, the first being Jack Johnson. Durán was known as a versatile brawler and pressure fighter, which earned him the nickname of "Manos de Piedra" ("Hands of Stone") for his formidable punching power.In 2002, Durán was voted by The Ring magazine as the fifth greatest fighter of the last 80 years, and is currently the 26th greatest pound for pound boxer of all time in Boxrec's ranking, while boxing historian Bert Sugar rated him as the eighth greatest fighter of all time. The Associated Press voted him as the best lightweight of the 20th century, with many considering him the greatest lightweight of all time. Durán finally retired in January 2002 at age 50 (having previously retired in 1998) following a car crash in October 2001, with a professional record of 119 fights, 103 wins, and 70 knockouts. Up until his fight with Wilfred Benítez in 1982, he was trained by legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel.
