All-female units of the paramilitary Red Guards served in the 1918 Finnish Civil War. The first Women's Guards units formed in early February in the main Finnish cities. More than 15 female Guards units were established by the end of March 1918, with a total of about 2,000 women serving. The female Guards units consisted of young industrial workers, maids, and servants. Their average age was about 20, but some were as young as 14. The women served in auxiliary units and in combat.
By joining the Red Guards, women stepped out of their traditional role in Finnish society and were demonised by the Whites, the anti-Communist paramilitary. The Red commanders were reluctant to commit the female Guards units to battle and usually held them in reserve. Towards the end of the war several saw combat. During the Battle of Tampere, the city hall was the last pocket of Red resistance; there is a legend that this was because while the male defenders wanted to capitulate the Tampere Women's Red Guard insisted on fighting to the last. 
The fiercely fought Finnish Civil War lasted 15 weeks. Both sides frequently shot prisoners out of hand and both sides executed civilians in campaigns of terror. Over 10,000 Reds were murdered in the subsequent White terror. Captured women who were considered to be armed fighters would usually be shot, and were sometimes raped before their execution.
