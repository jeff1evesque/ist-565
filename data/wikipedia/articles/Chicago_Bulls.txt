The Chicago Bulls are an American professional basketball team based in Chicago, Illinois. The Bulls compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Central Division. The team was founded on January 16, 1966. The team plays its home games at the United Center, an arena shared with the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). 
The Bulls became one of the most successful teams in NBA history in the 1990s. Led by Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, rebounding specialist Dennis Rodman and coach Phil Jackson, the Bulls won six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998 with two three-peats, building one of the NBA's greatest dynasties. They were also responsible for popularizing the NBA worldwide during the 1990s. The Bulls are the only NBA franchise to win multiple championships and never lose an NBA Finals series in their history.
The Bulls won 72 games during the 1995–96 NBA season, setting an NBA record that stood until the Golden State Warriors won 73 games during the 2015–16 NBA season. The Bulls were the first team in NBA history to win 70 games or more in a single season, and the only NBA franchise to do so until the 2015–16 Warriors. Many experts and analysts consider the 1996 Bulls to be one of the greatest teams in NBA history.
Michael Jordan and Derrick Rose have both won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award while playing for the Bulls, for a total of six MVP awards.
The Bulls share rivalries with the Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, and the Miami Heat. The Bulls' rivalry with the Pistons was highlighted heavily during the late 1980s and early 1990s.
