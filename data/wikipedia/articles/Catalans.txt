The Catalans (Catalan, French and Occitan: catalans; Spanish: catalanes, Italian: catalani) are a Romance ethnic group native to Catalonia, a region spanning Spain in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, and southeastern France.
The inhabitants of the Roussillon historical region in southern France (known in Catalonia as Northern Catalonia and in France as the Catalan country) are often included in this definition.
