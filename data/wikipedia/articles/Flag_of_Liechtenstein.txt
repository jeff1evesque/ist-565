The flag of Liechtenstein (German: Flagge Liechtensteins) consists of two horizontal blue and red bands charged with a gold crown at the canton.  Adopted in 1921 after being officially enshrined into the nation's constitution, it has been the flag of the Principality of Liechtenstein since that year.  The crown was added to the flag in 1937 after the country found out at the Summer Olympics held the previous year that their flag was identical to the flag of Haiti.
