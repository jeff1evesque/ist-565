Novak Djokovic was the defending champion, but lost in the final to Stan Wawrinka, 7–6(7–1), 4–6, 5–7, 3–6. This was the first time the men's singles champion at the US Open won the match after losing the first set since Juan Martín del Potro in 2009. This was also the first time the men's singles champion at the US Open won the title after being a match point down since Djokovic in 2011, with Wawrinka having saved a match point against Dan Evans in the 3rd round. As he had done in his 2 previous grand slam titles, Wawrinka again defeated the world No. 1 in the final.
This was the first US Open since 1999 not to feature five-time champion Roger Federer. It was also the first Grand Slam tournament since the 2004 French Open in which none of Federer, Rafael Nadal, or Andy Murray reached the semifinals. This was also the first time since the 2010 French Open that only one of the Big Four players advanced to the semifinals.
This was also the first US Open in the Open Era to feature 3 French quarterfinalists with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Lucas Pouille, and Gaël Monfils all reaching that round. In addition, no American player was seeded inside the top 16 for the first time since the introduction of the seeding system in 1930. 	
This was the first Grand Slam that Tomáš Berdych, world number 8 at the time, had missed since his maiden Slam at the 2003 US Open ending his streak of 52 consecutive grand slam appearances, sixth all time.  The reason for his withdrawal was appendicitis.
