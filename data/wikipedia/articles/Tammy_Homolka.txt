Tammy Lyn Homolka (January 1, 1975 – December 24, 1990) was the younger sister and victim of Canadian murderer Karla Homolka and her partner, Paul Bernardo. On 24 December 1990, less than two weeks before Tammy's 16th birthday, Karla Homolka and her fiancé Bernardo plied Tammy with alcoholic drinks laced with the sedative Halcion. When she became unconscious, the two raped her. Tammy became sick while sedated and died. After failed attempts to revive her, Karla covered up evidence of the assault and called an ambulance. Her official cause of death was listed as choking to death on her own vomit, and was believed at the time to have been an accident. After Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka were arrested for the murders of Leslie Mahaffy and Kristen French, Tammy Homolka's body was exhumed. She is interred at Victoria Lawn Cemetery in St. Catharines, Ontario.
