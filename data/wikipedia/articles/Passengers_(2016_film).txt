Passengers is a 2016 American science fiction romance film directed by Morten Tyldum and written by Jon Spaihts. The film stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as Aurora Lane and Jim Preston, respectively, with Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne in supporting roles. The plot depicts two people who are awakened ninety years too early from an induced hibernation on a spaceship, transporting thousands of passengers, travelling to a distant colony planet.
The film was originally written in 2007 by Spaihts but was kept in development hell, with multiple actors attached throughout the years. In December 2014, Sony Pictures Entertainment picked up the film's rights, with Tyldum attached to direct. Pratt and Lawrence were cast as the two leads in February 2015. The film was produced by Village Roadshow Pictures, Start Motion Pictures, Original Film, LStar Capital, Wanda Pictures and Company Films. Principal photography took place at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Atlanta, Georgia from September 2015 to February 2016.
Passengers premiered at the Regency Village Theater in Los Angeles on December 14, 2016 and was released theatrically in the United States on December 21, 2016, in 2D and RealD 3D by Columbia Pictures. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Pratt and Lawrence's performances, as well as the score, visual style and production values, though criticism was directed at the plot and characters. It grossed $303 million worldwide, becoming the third-biggest original live-action US release of 2016. The film received two Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score and Best Production Design at the 89th Academy Awards.
