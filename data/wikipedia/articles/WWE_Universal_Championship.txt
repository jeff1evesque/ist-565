The WWE Universal Championship is a world heavyweight championship created and promoted by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE on the Raw brand. It is one of two world titles for WWE's main roster, alongside the WWE Championship on the SmackDown brand. The current champion is Roman Reigns, who is in his first reign.
Named in honor of the WWE Universe, the championship was established on July 25, 2016 to be the world championship of the Raw brand. Its creation came as a result of the re-introduction of the brand split and subsequent draft on July 19, 2016 in which the WWE Championship, the promotion's original world title, became exclusive to SmackDown. The inaugural Universal Champion was Finn BÃ¡lor. Since its inception, matches for the championship have headlined several pay-per-view events, including SummerSlam in 2017 and 2018, and WrestleMania 34, both being two of WWE's "big four" pay-per-views, the latter of which is WWE's flagship event.
