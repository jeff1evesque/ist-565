Nicole Brown Simpson (May 19, 1959 â€“ June 12, 1994) was the German-American wife of retired professional football player and actor O. J. Simpson and the mother of their two children, Sydney and Justin. She was found murdered at her home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, USA on June 13, 1994, along with her friend, 25-year-old American restaurant waiter Ron Goldman. Simpson was charged with both murders; after a controversial and highly-publicized criminal trial, Simpson was acquitted in 1995, but found liable for both deaths in a civil suit in 1997 and ordered to pay $33.5 million in punitive damages to the Brown and Goldman families.
