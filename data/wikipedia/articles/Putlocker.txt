Putlocker refers to an online index of hosted files and various websites used for streaming entertainment media, such as films and television series. The initial website originated in the United Kingdom as early as 2011, and grew to receive millions of daily visitors after the shutdown of Megaupload. In May 2016, the website was blocked in the UK by a High Court order, and at its peak prior to a temporary closure in late 2016, Alexa Internet listed Putlocker as ranking among the top 250 most-visited websites worldwide. Putlocker has been reported by the Motion Picture Association of America as a major piracy threat.Putlocker's domain address has changed multiple times throughout its history, with the most recent domain seizure being that of the URL putlockers.ch, which was suspended and transferred to the ownership of EuroDNS, by order of a Luxembourg court. It is not publicly known whether or not an official Putlocker website maintained by the original team remains available online, but at least fifty mirror or proxy websites, many of which use the Putlocker name, have been identified.
