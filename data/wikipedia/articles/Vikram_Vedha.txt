Principal photography started in November of the same year and was completed by January 2017. The film was shot mainly in North Chennai, with the area being used as its backdrop.

Made on a budget of ₹110 million (about US$1,661,631 in 2017), the film performed well at the box office, grossing ₹600 million (about US$9,063,444 in 2017) worldwide despite experiencing difficulties due to the changes resulting from the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax.
