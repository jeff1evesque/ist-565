Hernan Enrique Salazar "Shades" Alvarez is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the father of Victor Alvarez and is frequently seen with his partner in crime Comanche.
The character's birth name came as a change to the character in the Netflix series Luke Cage, where he is played by Theo Rossi. No explanation has been given for why he uses what is presumably his mother's surname, Álvarez, instead of his father's, Sálazar.
