Amanda Blake Waller is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in Legends #1 in 1986, and was created by John Ostrander, Len Wein, and John Byrne. Amanda Waller is an antagonist and occasional ally to the superheroes of the DC Universe.
Depicted as an overweight black woman, Amanda Waller has the distinction of being the sole African-American villainess in the DC Universe.  She is the director for the deadly missions of the Suicide Squad and a specialist who oversees research into people with powers. Although she lacks superpowers herself, the character is a ruthless, high-ranking government official who uses guile, political connections, and sheer intimidation to achieve her goals, often in the name of national security. Waller is commonly associated with the fictional government agencies Checkmate and A.R.G.U.S.
In 2009, Amanda Waller was ranked as IGN's 60th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time. In recent years, the character has been substantially adapted into animated and live action media. Several actresses have voiced or portrayed the character: C. C. H. Pounder for various animated projects; Pam Grier on the live-action series Smallville; Angela Bassett in the live-action film Green Lantern; Sheryl Lee Ralph in the animated series Young Justice; Cynthia Addai-Robinson in the live-action series Arrow; Yvette Nicole Brown in the animated series DC Super Hero Girls; and Viola Davis in the live-action film Suicide Squad.
