Sir Kenneth Arthur Dodd  (8 November 1927 â€“ 11 March 2018) was an English comedian, singer and occasional actor.  He was described as "the last great music hall entertainer", and was primarily known for his live stand-up performances.
A lifelong resident of Knotty Ash in Liverpool, Dodd's career as an entertainer started in the mid-1950s.  His performances included rapid and incessant delivery of often surreal jokes, and would run for several hours, frequently past midnight.  His verbal and physical comedy was supplemented by his red, white and blue "tickling stick" prop, and often introduced by his characteristic upbeat greeting of "How tickled I am!"   He interspersed the comedy with songs, both serious and humorous, and with his original speciality, ventriloquism.  He also had several hit singles primarily as a ballad singer in the 1960s, and occasionally appeared in dramatic roles.  He performed on radio and television, and popularised the characters of the Diddy Men.
He was knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to entertainment and charity.  His stage career lasted for over 60 years, and he continued to perform, when his health permitted, until his death at the age of 90.
