Transformers: The Last Knight is a 2017 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers franchise. It is the fifth installment of the live-action Transformers film series and a sequel to 2014's Age of Extinction. Like its predecessors, the film is directed by Michael Bay, and features Mark Wahlberg returning from Age of Extinction, with Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, and Glenn Morshower reprising their roles from the first three films, as well as Laura Haddock and Anthony Hopkins both joining the cast. Bay has suggested that it will be his final film in the franchise.
The film premiered at Odeon Leicester Square in London on June 18, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 21, 2017, by Paramount Pictures in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D. The film was met with an unfavorable reception from critics and, with an approval rating of 16% on Rotten Tomatoes, it is the worst-reviewed film of the Transformers series; at the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards, it was nominated for ten awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Director and Worst Actor for Wahlberg, but did not win any. It grossed $605 million worldwide over a budget of $217 million, making it the lowest grossing film of the franchise.
A spin-off/prequel, entitled Bumblebee, is scheduled for release on December 21, 2018.
