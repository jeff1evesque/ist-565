Connor McDavid (born January 13, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre and captain for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected first overall by the Oilers in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. In his second season in the NHL McDavid won the Art Ross Trophy as the leading scorer in the league, the Hart Memorial Trophy, given to the player judged most valuable to his team, and the Ted Lindsay Award as the best player voted by other NHL players.
McDavid grew up in the Toronto area and played hockey there, and was granted "Exceptional Player" status by Hockey Canada, which allowed him to play major junior one year early. He thus joined the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and spent three years with the Otters before the Oilers selected in him the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Internationally McDavid played for the Canadian national junior team at one World U18 Championship, two World Junior Championships, and for the senior team at one World Championship, winning one gold at every level.
