Super Mario Galaxy is a 2007 platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Wii. It is the third 3D game in the Super Mario series. The story revolves around the protagonist, Mario, who is on a quest to rescue Princess Peach whilst simultaneously saving the universe from Bowser.
The levels in the game consist of galaxies filled with minor planets and worlds, with different variations of gravity, the central element of gameplay. The concept for the game's use of spherical platforms was first conceptualised from ideas used in Super Mario 128, a technology demonstration shown at Nintendo Space World in 2000. Development of Super Mario Galaxy began after the release of Donkey Kong Jungle Beat in late 2004, after Shigeru Miyamoto suggested that Nintendo should commission a large-scale Mario game. The game's soundtrack was composed by Mahito Yokota and Koji Kondo, using a symphony orchestra for the first time in the series.
Super Mario Galaxy was a critical and commercial success, hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time. Critics praised the game's graphics, gravity mechanics, soundtrack, and setting. Upon release it won several awards from gaming publications, including multiple "Game of the Year" titles, and became the first Nintendo title to win the British Academy Games Award for Best Game. The game is the ninth best-selling Wii game worldwide with sales of 12.77 million, as well as the best-selling 3D entry in the Super Mario series. The game was re-released as a Nintendo Selects title in 2011, as a download via the Wii U's eShop in 2015, and on the Nvidia Shield, exclusive to the Chinese market, in 2018. A direct sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, was released for the Wii in 2010.
