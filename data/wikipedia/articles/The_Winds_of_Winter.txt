The Winds of Winter is the planned sixth novel in the epic fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin.
Martin believes the last two volumes of the series will be books of 1,500+ manuscript pages each. They will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and the Others will appear in The Winds of Winter. Martin has refrained from making hard estimates for the final release date of the novel. In April 2018, Martin revealed that the book would not be published in 2018.
