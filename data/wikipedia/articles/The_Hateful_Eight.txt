The Hateful Eight (often marketed as The H8ful Eight) is a 2015 American Western film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. It stars Samuel L. Jackson, Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Walton Goggins, Demi√°n Bichir, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, and Bruce Dern as eight strangers who seek refuge from a blizzard in a stagecoach stopover some time after the American Civil War.
Tarantino announced The Hateful Eight in November 2013. He conceived it as a novel and sequel to his previous film Django Unchained (2012) before deciding to make it a standalone film. After the script leaked in January 2014, he cancelled the film, directed a live reading at the United Artists Theater in Los Angeles, then announced that he had changed his mind. Filming began on December 8, 2014, near Telluride, Colorado. The original score was Italian composer Ennio Morricone's first for a Tarantino film, his first complete Western score in 34 years, and his first for a high-profile Hollywood production since Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars in 2000.
Distributed by The Weinstein Company in the United States, The Hateful Eight was released on December 25, 2015, in a roadshow release in 70 mm film. The film had a wide digital release on December 30, 2015. It received largely positive reviews, with Leigh's performance being praised. For his work on the score, Morricone won the Golden Globe and his first Academy Award for Best Original Score. The film also earned Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress (Leigh) and Best Cinematography (Robert Richardson).
