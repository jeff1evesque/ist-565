Samantha Zoe Womack (n√©e Janus; born 2 November 1972) is a British actress, singer and director who has worked in film, television and stage.
Womack made her name in the mid-1990s with her role as Mandy Wilkins in Game On. In recent years she has been best known for playing the role of Ronnie Mitchell in EastEnders from 2007 before leaving in 2011. She returned to the role in 2013 and continued until leaving for good in early 2017 when the character was killed off. Her portrayal as Ronnie has gained her more prominence and acting roles after being out of the limelight for numerous years. Womack has since became a household name and Ronnie has become one of the most iconic EastEnders characters since it began in 1985. For this role, Womack has been awarded and nominated for numerous awards.
She also played Tanya Porter in Sky One comedy-drama Mount Pleasant from 2013 until the final episode in 2017. Since leaving EastEnders, Womack has toured across the United Kingdom playing Morticia in the stage musical The Addams Family.
Womack initially planned a career in singing and she represented the United Kingdom in the 1991 Eurovision Song Contest. Her song for the contest, "A Message to Your Heart", was released as her first (and only) single in April 1991 and reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Chart. The response to the performance made her rethink her plans and she later began a successful acting career although her first role was in a film adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde the year before her appearance at Eurovision.
