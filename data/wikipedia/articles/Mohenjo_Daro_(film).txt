Mohenjo Daro is a 2016 Indian epic romantic adventure film, written and directed by Ashutosh Gowariker.  It is produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur for UTV Motion Pictures and Sunita Gowariker for Ashutosh Gowariker Productions (AGPPL), and features Hrithik Roshan and Pooja Hegde in the lead roles. It is a cinematic presentation based on the ancient Indus Valley civilization, and its city Mohenjo-daro, a UNESCO World Heritage site, located in Sindh, Pakistan.
Set in 2016 BC at the height of Indus Valley Civilization, the story follows a farmer Sarmad (Hrithik Roshan) who travels to the city of Mohenjo Daro and falls in love with a high-status woman (Hegde), and who must then challenge the city's elite, and fight against overwhelming odds to save their civilization. Gowariker took over three years to research and develop the script, working closely with archaeologists to ensure authenticity in the representation of his fictional story. The film was shot in Bhuj and Mumbai with brief schedules in Bhedaghat (Jabalpur) and Thane.
The soundtrack album and film score were composed by A. R. Rahman with song lyrics penned by Javed Akhtar. The film was released worldwide on 12 August 2016 to generally mixed reviews from critics.
