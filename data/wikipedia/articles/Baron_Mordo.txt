Baron Karl Amadeus Mordo (known as Baron Mordo) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  The character is depicted commonly as an adversary of Doctor Strange. The character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in Strange Tales #111 (August 1963). Baron Mordo is a gifted magician, especially adept in the black arts of magic, including summoning demons.
Karl Mordo studied the magic arts under the Ancient One in Tibet when Dr. Stephen Strange came to study there. Strange foiled Baron Mordo's plot to kill the Ancient One, leading to Baron Mordo being cast out and Dr. Strange eventually becoming "Sorcerer Supreme." Mordo would clash with Dr. Strange on a multitude of occasions, at times with the backing of the demon Dormammu, going so far as successfully impersonating Dr. Strange for a short period of time. In Uncanny Avengers #6 Baron Mordo is described as deceased but details of his death are not given.
Outside of comics the Baron Mordo character has appeared in the Spider-Man: The Animated Series and The Super Hero Squad Show cartoon series. He was also one of the main characters in the 2007 animated film Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. Mordo appears in the Marvel Studios film Doctor Strange, portrayed by Chiwetel Ejiofor.
