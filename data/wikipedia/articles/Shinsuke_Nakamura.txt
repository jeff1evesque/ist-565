Shinsuke Nakamura (中邑 真輔, Nakamura Shinsuke, born February 24, 1980) is a Japanese professional wrestler and former mixed martial artist. He is signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand and is the current United States Champion in his first reign. Prior to his main roster debut, Nakamura competed in WWE's developmental brand, NXT, where he is one of only two wrestlers (along with Samoa Joe) to have held the NXT Championship on more than one occasion.

Nakamura is perhaps best known for his work in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he is a former three-time IWGP Heavyweight Champion, with his first reign coming at the age of 23 years and 9 months, making him the youngest champion in the title's history. He is also a record setting five-time and longest reigning IWGP Intercontinental Champion with his first reign lasting 313 days, a one-time IWGP Tag Team Champion (with Hiroshi Tanahashi), and the winner of the 2011 G1 Climax, 2006 G1 Tag League and 2014 New Japan Cup tournaments.
