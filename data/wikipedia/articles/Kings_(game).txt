Kings (king's cup, donut, jug oval, or ring of fire) is a drinking game that uses playing cards. The players must drink and dispense drinks based on cards drawn, with each card having rule that is predetermined before the game starts. Typically, the first three king cards drawn require every player to pour some of their drink into the "King's Cup" in the center of the table, and whoever draws the fourth king must drink it.
Often groups establish house rules with their own variation of rules.
