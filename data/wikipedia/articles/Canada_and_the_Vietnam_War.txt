The Vietnam War had considerable effects on Canada â€“ and Canada and Canadians affected the war.
The Canadian government did not officially participate in the war.  However, it contributed peacekeeping forces in 1973 to help enforce the Paris Peace Accords.Privately, some Canadians contributed to the war effort.  Canadian corporations sold war materiel to the Americans. In addition, at least 30,000 Canadians volunteered to serve in the American armed forces during the war.  At least 134 Canadians died or were reported missing in Vietnam.Meanwhile, tens of thousands of American Vietnam War resisters emigrated to Canada to avoid the draft.  Largely middle class and educated, they had a significant impact on Canadian life.  After the war, tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people were also admitted and became a unique part of Canadian life.
