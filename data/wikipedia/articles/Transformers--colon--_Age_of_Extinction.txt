Transformers: Age of Extinction is a 2014 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers franchise. It is the fourth installment of the live-action Transformers film series and a stand-alone sequel to 2011's Dark of the Moon, taking place five years after its events. Like its predecessors, it was directed by Michael Bay and written by Ehren Kruger, with Steven Spielberg and Bay as executive producers. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammer, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor, and Sophia Myles, with Peter Cullen reprising as the voice of Optimus Prime. It is the first film in the series not to feature the human cast from the previous three films, but features a new cast of human characters and many new Transformers, including the Dinobots. The film was released on June 27, 2014, in IMAX and 3D.Transformers: Age of Extinction received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, many of whom considered it poorly directed, badly acted, terribly written, overlong, and having awful product placement, but received some praise for its action sequences, stunts, effects, musical score and the performances of Wahlberg, Tucci, Grammer, and Cullen. The film received seven nominations at the 35th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, with Bay and Grammer winning the awards for Worst Director and Worst Supporting Actor, respectively. Despite poor reviews, it was a massive box office success, grossing over $1.104 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 2014, the second-highest-grossing film in the Transformers series, the 19th film to gross over $1 billion, and the 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time. It was the sole film to gross over $1 billion in 2014.
A sequel, The Last Knight, was released on June 21, 2017, with Wahlberg, Tucci, and Cullen returning, and Bay directing.
