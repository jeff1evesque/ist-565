A Hertzoggie, also known in Afrikaans as a Hertzogkoekie or in English as a Hertzog Cookie, is a jam-filled tartlet or cookie with a coconut topping commonly served on a cup-like pastry base. 
The cookie is a popular dessert in South Africa where it is often eaten with a cup of English tea.  In the Cape-Malay community the dessert is often eaten during Eid.  It is often baked at home as part of a dessert-baking cottage industry in the country and sold alongside other popular South African desserts such as Koeksisters.
