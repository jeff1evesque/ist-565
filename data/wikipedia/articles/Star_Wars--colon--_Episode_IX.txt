Star Wars: Episode IX is an upcoming American epic space opera film co-written and directed by J. J. Abrams. It is intended to be the third and final installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy and the ninth installment of the main Star Wars film franchise, following The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. The film is produced by Lucasfilm and Bad Robot Productions and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.
The film was announced after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012, with Colin Trevorrow announced as the film's director in August 2015. In September 2017, Trevorrow left the project due to creative differences; he was replaced by Abrams, who previously directed The Force Awakens. Filming began in August 2018 at Pinewood Studios in London. Episode IX is set to be released on December 20, 2019 in the United States.
