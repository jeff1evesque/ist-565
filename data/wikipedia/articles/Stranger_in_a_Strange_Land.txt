Stranger in a Strange Land is a 1961 science fiction novel by American author Robert A. Heinlein.  It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians.  The novel explores his interaction with—and eventual transformation of—Terran culture. In 2012, the US Library of Congress named it one of 88 "Books that Shaped America".The title "Stranger in a Strange Land" is an allusion to the phrase in Exodus 2:22.
According to Heinlein, the novel's working title was The Heretic.
In 1991, three years after Heinlein's death, his widow, Virginia Heinlein, arranged to have the original uncut manuscript published. Critics disagree about which version is superior, though Heinlein preferred the original manuscript and described the heavily edited version as "telegraphese".
