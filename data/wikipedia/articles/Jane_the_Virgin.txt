Jane the Virgin is an American satirical romantic comedy drama developed by Jennie Snyder Urman, that debuted on The CW on October 13, 2014. It is a loose adaptation of the Venezuelan telenovela Juana la Virgen created by Perla Farías. The series stars Gina Rodriguez as Jane Villanueva, a working, religious young Latina virgin, who becomes pregnant after accidentally being artificially inseminated. The program parodies commonly used tropes and devices in Latin telenovelas.
At the 72nd Golden Globe Awards, Jane the Virgin was nominated for the award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, received the Peabody Award, and Gina Rodriguez won the award for Best Actress – Television Series, Musical or Comedy. It was also named a TV Program of the Year by the American Film Institute.
Beginning with the fourth episode of season three, the series' on-screen title card was modified, with "The Virgin" crossed out in favor of a substitute each episode. This mirrored the storyline, in which Jane is no longer a virgin.On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a fifth and final season.
