Edgar Howard Wright (born 18 April 1974) is an English director, screenwriter and producer. He began making independent short films before making his first feature film A Fistful of Fingers (1995). Wright created and directed the comedy series Asylum in 1996, written with David Walliams. After directing several other television shows, Wright directed the sitcom Spaced (1999–2001), which aired for two series and starred frequent collaborators Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.
In 2004, Wright directed the first film in the Three Flavours Cornetto, the horror comedy Shaun of the Dead, starring Pegg and Frost. The film was co-written with Pegg—as were the next two entries in the trilogy, Hot Fuzz (2007) and The World's End (2013), which Wright directed and also starred the pair. In 2010, Wright co-wrote, produced, and directed the comedy action film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Along with Joe Cornish and Steven Moffat, he co-wrote Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin (2011). Wright and Cornish co-wrote the screenplay for the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Ant-Man in 2015, which Wright intended to direct but abandoned, citing creative differences. His latest film, the action comedy Baby Driver, was released in 2017.
Wright has also directed numerous music videos, including The Bluetones' "Keep the Home Fires Burning" (2000), The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster's  "Psychosis Safari" (2002), Mint Royale's "Blue Song" (2002), Pharrell Williams' "Gust of Wind" (2014), and Beck’s "Colors" (2018).
