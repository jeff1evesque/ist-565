The film is an Old Westâ€“style remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 Japanese film Seven Samurai.

The film's musical score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. In 2013, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".
