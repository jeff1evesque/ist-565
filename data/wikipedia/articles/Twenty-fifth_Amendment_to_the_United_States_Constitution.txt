The Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States Constitution deals with issues related to presidential succession and disability. It clarifies Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 by stating emphatically that the Vice President becomes President (as opposed to Acting President) if the President dies, resigns, is removed from office; and establishes procedures both for filling a vacancy in the office of the Vice President and for responding to presidential disabilities. The Twenty-fifth Amendment was submitted to the states on July 6, 1965 by the 89th Congress and was adopted on February 10, 1967.
