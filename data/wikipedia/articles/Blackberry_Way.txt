"Blackberry Way" is a 1968 single by English band The Move.
Written by Roy Wood and produced by Jimmy Miller, "Blackberry Way" was a bleak counterpoint to the sunny psychedelia of earlier recordings. It nevertheless became the band's most successful single, reaching number 1 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1969. Richard Tandy, who later played keyboards with Wood's next band Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), played harpsichord on "Blackberry Way". Despite the success of the single, the style of psychedelically tinged pop sat uneasily with bassist Trevor Burton. He left the group shortly after. It is cited as inspired by The Beatles' "Penny Lane", and the vocal line from the bridge is borrowed from "Good Old Desk" by Harry Nilsson.
The  B-side was specially written for the band by David Scott-Morgan.
