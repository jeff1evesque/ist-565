Falcon Nest is a detached residence in Prescott, Arizona, that is the tallest single family home in North America at 124 feet (38 m). Its name is attributed to its resemblance to a large mountainside bird's nest and the peregrine falcons that inhabit the area. It is located in Yavapai County, approximately a two-hour drive northwest of Arizona's capitol, Phoenix.
