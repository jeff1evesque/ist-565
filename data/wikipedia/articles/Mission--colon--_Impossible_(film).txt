Mission: Impossible is a 1996 American action spy film film directed by Brian De Palma, produced by and starring Tom Cruise. Based on the television series of the same name, the plot follows Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his mission to uncover the mole who has framed him for the murders of his entire Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team. Work on the script had begun early with filmmaker Sydney Pollack on board, before De Palma, Steven Zaillian, David Koepp, and Robert Towne were brought in. Mission: Impossible went into pre-production without a shooting script: De Palma devised several action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events.
U2 band members Larry Mullen, Jr. and Adam Clayton produced an electronic dance version of the original theme music. The tune was a top 10 hit in the US (receiving gold record certification), and 6 other countries. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. 
The film was a commercial success, eventually becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1996, and received a mixed-to-favorable response from critics. The film's success spawned the Mission: Impossible film series.
