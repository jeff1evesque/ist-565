Kimberly McLean, alias Lori Erica Kennedy Ruff (October 16, 1968 – December 24, 2010) was an identity thief who remained unidentified for nearly six years after her death. Ruff was eventually identified as a native of the Philadelphia area who moved away from her Wyncote home in fall of 1986 and later vanished after struggling to adapt to her parents' divorce. Within the next two years, she obtained the birth certificate of Becky Sue Turner, who had died in a fire in Fife, Washington near Tacoma at the age of 2 in 1971. Ruff used the certificate to get an Idaho identification card, then moved to Texas and changed her name to Lori Erica Kennedy.
Kennedy gradually acquired more documents in that name, including a new Social Security number. After earning a college degree, she married – becoming Lori Erica Ruff – and had a child. Due to some of her unusual behavior and her unwillingness to speak of her past, she clashed with her in-laws and the marriage collapsed. She ended her own life at her father-in-law's home in Longview on Christmas Eve 2010.After her death, her husband and his family found the evidence of her falsified identity in a lock box in her closet. Her true origins remained a mystery until 2016, when  forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick discovered her identity using direct-to-consumer autosomal SNP analysis on her husband and her daughter's DNA that led investigators to the McLean family, still living outside Philadelphia.
