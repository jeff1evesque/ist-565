Brooks Koepka (born May 3, 1990) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour. Ranked as high as second in the Official World Golf Ranking, he started his career on the European Challenge Tour and eventually the European Tour. He played collegiate golf at Florida State University.
Koepka claimed his first major championship at the U.S. Open in 2017 at Erin Hills, Wisconsin. He successfully defended his title in 2018 at Shinnecock Hills on Long Island, the first golfer to win consecutive U.S. Opens since Curtis Strange in 1988 and 1989. He won his third major at the 2018 PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club, shooting a major championship record-tying 264 over 72 holes. On Sunday at Bellerive, Koepka shot a 5-under 66 to hold off Tiger Woods, who charges into second place on Sunday. His 2018 victories in the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship was the first instance of that double since Tiger Woods in 2000.
