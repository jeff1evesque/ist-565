Sirhan Bishara Sirhan (; Arabic: سرحان بشارة سرحان‎, born March 19, 1944) is a Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship who shot and mortally wounded Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968; Kennedy died the following day. Sirhan was convicted of murder and is serving a life sentence at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego County, California.
Sirhan was born in Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine to an Arab Christian family of Greek Orthodox background, although he attended a Lutheran school. In 1989, he told David Frost, "My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 [fighter jet] bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians." Some scholars believe that the assassination was the first major incident of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab–Israeli conflict in the Middle East.
