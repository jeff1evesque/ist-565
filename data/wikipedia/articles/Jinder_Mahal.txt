Yuvraj Singh Dhesi (born July 19, 1986) is an Indian-Canadian professional wrestler currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Jinder Mahal.Having begun his career on the independent circuit, he joined WWE in 2010, making his debut on the company's main roster the following year. After a short-lived alliance with his storyline brother-in-law The Great Khali, Mahal was then mostly utilized as enhancement talent during his initial stint with WWE, forming the group 3MB with fellow lower card wrestlers Heath Slater and Drew McIntyre before both Mahal and McIntyre were released from the company in June 2014. Mahal returned to WWE two years later with a dramatically improved body condition and received a push following WrestleMania 33, culminating in a win over Randy Orton at Backlash in May 2017 for the WWE Championship, becoming the 50th WWE Champion and the first wrestler of Indian descent to win the title. Mahal later won the WWE United States Championship at WrestleMania 34 in April 2018.
