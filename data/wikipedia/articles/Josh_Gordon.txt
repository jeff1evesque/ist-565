Joshua Caleb Gordon (born April 13, 1991), nicknamed "Flash", is an American football wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Baylor, and was drafted by the Browns in the second round of the 2012 NFL Supplemental Draft.
Gordon's first two NFL seasons were highly productive; in 2013, his second season, he led all players in receiving yards and was a first-team All-Pro selection. In his NFL career, Gordon has been suspended multiple times for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. He was indefinitely suspended by the league for his fourth violation during the 2014 season, being unable to play for the rest of that season, along with the entirety of the next two seasons. Following a lengthy rehabilitation period, he was reinstated midway through the 2017 season.
