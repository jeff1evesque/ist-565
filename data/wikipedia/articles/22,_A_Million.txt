22, A Million is the third studio album by American indie folk band Bon Iver, released on September 30, 2016.

First premiered at Vernon's Eaux Claires Music Festival, the album debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 and received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its original sound and colorful lyricism. Several publications, including Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, and The Guardian, listed 22, A Million as one of the best albums of 2016.
