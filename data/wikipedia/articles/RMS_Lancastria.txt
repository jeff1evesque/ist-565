RMS Lancastria (later HMT Lancastria) was a British Cunard liner requisitioned by the UK Government during World War II.  She was sunk on 17 June 1940 during Operation Ariel.  Having received an emergency order to evacuate British nationals and troops in excess of its capacity of 1,300 passengers, modern estimates range between 3,000 and 5,800 fatalitiesâ€”the largest single-ship loss of life in British maritime history.  The sinking of HMT Lancastria claimed more lives than the combined losses of the RMS Titanic (1,517 passengers and crew) and RMS Lusitania (1,198 passengers).
