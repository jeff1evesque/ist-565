Joel Hans Embiid ( joh-EL EM-beed; born 16 March 1994) is a Cameroonian professional basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). After one year of college basketball with the Kansas Jayhawks, he was drafted with the third overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the 76ers. Multiple foot and knee injuries delayed his debut for two seasons until 2016–17, when he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team despite playing only 31 games. Embiid was named an All-Star in 2017–18. He has nicknamed himself "The Process" in response to a refrain from 76ers fans during the Sam Hinkie-era to "trust the process".
