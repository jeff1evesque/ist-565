Robert Ivan Nichols, alias Joseph Newton Chandler III (September 12, 1926 â€“ c. July 23, 2002) was a formerly unidentified identity thief who committed suicide in Eastlake, Ohio, in July 2002. After his death, investigators were unable to locate his family and discovered that he had stolen the identity of an eight-year-old boy who was killed in a car crash in Texas in 1945.The lengths to which Nichols went to hide his identity led to speculation that he was a fugitive.In late 2016, U.S. Marshals Service announced that forensic genealogist Dr. Colleen Fitzpatrick of Identifinders International had compared Chandler's Y-STR profile to public genetic genealogy Y-STR databases to determine his possible last name was "Nicholas". In 2017 Fitzpatrick along with Dr. Margaret Press formed the non-profit DNA Doe Project, which revisited the Chandler case by analyzing his autosomal DNA using the same methodology they used in identifying Marcia King and Lyle Stevik.  In March 2018 the DNA Doe Project identified Chandler as Robert Ivan Nichols. The U.S. Marshals Service announced the identification at a press conference in Cleveland on June 21, 2018.
