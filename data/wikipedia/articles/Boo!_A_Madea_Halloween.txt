Tyler Perry's Boo! A Madea Halloween is a 2016 American comedy horror film directed, written, starring and co-produced by Tyler Perry. The idea for the film originated from a fictitious Madea Halloween movie that was mentioned in Chris Rock's 2014 film Top Five. It is the ninth in the Madea series and the second Madea film (the first is Madea's Witness Protection) to not be adapted from a stage play.
The film was released on October 21, 2016, by Lionsgate, received generally negative reviews, and grossed $74 million, making it the second-highest grossing Madea film. A sequel, titled Boo 2! A Madea Halloween, was released on October 20, 2017.
