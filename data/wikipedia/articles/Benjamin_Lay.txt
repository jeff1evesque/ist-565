Benjamin Lay (1682 – February 8, 1759) was an Anglo-American Quaker humanitarian and abolitionist. He is best known for his early and strident anti-slavery activites which would culminate in dramatic protests. He was also an author, farmer, and early vegetarian.Born in England, into a farming family, his early trade was as a shepard and glove-maker. After becoming a Quaker, he worked as a sailor, and in 1718 moved to Barbados. Here he witnessed the poor treatment of African slaves that instilled in him his lifelong abolitionist principles. Lay later settled in Philadelphia, and was made unpopular among his fellow quakers, by his strident anti-slavery stance, which would often culminate in acts of public protest. He published several pamphlets on social causes during his lifetime, and one book – All Slave-keepers that keep the Innocent in Bondage, Apostates.
Lay was also distinguished by his early concern over the treatment of animals, and was an early vegetarian.
