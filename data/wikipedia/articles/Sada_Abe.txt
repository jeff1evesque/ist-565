Sada Abe (阿部 定, Abe Sada, May 28, 1905 – after 1971) was a Japanese woman, a geisha and sex worker, who is remembered for erotically asphyxiating her lover, Kichizō Ishida (石田 吉蔵), on May 18, 1936, and then cutting off his penis and testicles and carrying them around with her in her kimono.  The story became a national sensation in Japan, acquiring mythic overtones, and has been interpreted by artists, philosophers, novelists and filmmakers.  Abe was released after having served 5 years in prison and went on to write an autobiography.
