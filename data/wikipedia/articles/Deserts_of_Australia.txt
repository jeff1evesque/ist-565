Named deserts of Australia cover 1,371,000 square kilometres (529,000 sq mi), or 18% of the Australian mainland. However, approximately 35% of the Australian continent receives so little rain it is effectively desert. The  deserts in Australia are primarily distributed throughout the western plateau and interior lowlands of the continent.By international standards, Australian deserts receive relatively high rates of rainfall.  No weather station situated in an arid region records less than 100 mm of average annual rainfall. The deserts of Australia, particularly in the interior, lack any significant summer rains.Deserts are not necessarily completely devoid of vegetation, but have large areas where vegetation is very limited in height or extent.
