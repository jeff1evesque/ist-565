The White House Chief of Staff has traditionally been the highest-ranking and non-elected employee of the White House. The Chief of Staff position is the successor to the earlier role of the President's private secretary. The role was formalized as the Assistant to the President in 1946 and acquired its current title in 1961. The current official title is Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff.
The Chief of Staff is a political appointee of the President who does not require Senate confirmation, and who serves at the pleasure of the President.  The position is considered to be a stepping stone. Although not a legal requirement, each incoming President appoints their chief of staff.
In the administration of Donald Trump, the current Chief of Staff is John F. Kelly, who succeeded Reince Priebus on July 31, 2017.
