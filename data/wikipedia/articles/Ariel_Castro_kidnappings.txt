The Ariel Castro kidnappings took place between 2002 and 2004 when three young women – Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Georgina "Gina" DeJesus – were kidnapped by Ariel Castro and held captive in his home in the Tremont neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio. They were subsequently imprisoned until May 6, 2013, when Berry escaped with her six-year-old daughter and contacted the police. Knight and DeJesus were rescued by responding officers and Castro was arrested within hours.
On May 8, 2013, Castro was charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape, kidnapping, and aggravated murder as part of a plea bargain. He was sentenced to life plus 1,000 years in prison without the possibility of parole. One month into his sentence, Castro committed suicide by hanging himself with bedsheets in his prison cell.
