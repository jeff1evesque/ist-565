The World Chess Championship (sometimes abbreviated as WCC) is played to determine the World Champion in chess. Since 2014, the schedule has settled on a two-year cycle with a championship held in every even year.
The official world championship is generally regarded to have begun in 1886, when the two leading players in Europe and the United States, Johann Zukertort and Wilhelm Steinitz respectively, played a match. From 1886 to 1946, the champion set the terms, requiring any challenger to raise a sizable stake and defeat the champion in a match in order to become the new world champion. From 1948 to 1993, the championship was administered by FIDE, the World Chess Federation. In 1993, the reigning champion (Garry Kasparov) broke away from FIDE, which led to the creation of the rival PCA championship. The titles were unified at the World Chess Championship 2006.
Magnus Carlsen has been world champion since winning the World Chess Championship 2013 against Viswanathan Anand. He successfully defended his title against Anand in the World Chess Championship 2014 and against Sergey Karjakin in the World Chess Championship 2016. He is due to play Fabiano Caruana for the championship in November 2018.
Though the world championship is open to all players, there are separate events and titles for the Women's World Chess Championship, the World Junior Chess Championship (for players under 20 years of age, though there are younger age events also), and the World Senior Chess Championship (for men above 60 years of age, and women above 50). There are also faster time limit events, the World Rapid Chess Championship and the World Blitz Chess Championship. There is also a World Computer Chess Championship.
