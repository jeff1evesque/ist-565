The Merseyside derby is the name given to football matches between Everton and Liverpool, two major clubs from Liverpool, Merseyside, England. It is the longest running top-flight derby in England, having been played continuously since the 1962â€“63 season. Part of the rivalry is due to the proximity of the two clubs, whose home grounds are within eyesight of each other across Stanley Park, Everton at Goodison Park and Liverpool at Anfield.Traditionally, the Merseyside derby was referred to as the "friendly derby" because of the large number of families with both Liverpool and Everton supporters and was one of the few that did not enforce total fan segregation. The 1984 Football League Cup Final at Wembley saw almost all sections of the ground mixed and combined chants of "Merseyside, Merseyside" and "Are you watching Manchester?" Since the mid-1980s, however, the rivalry has intensified on and off the field, and since the inception of the Premier League has had more red cards than any other game.
