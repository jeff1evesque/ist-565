Trailer Park Boys is a Canadian mockumentary television series created and directed by Mike Clattenburg. The show focused on the misadventures of a group of trailer park residents, some of whom are ex-convicts, living in the fictional Sunnyvale Trailer Park in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The television series, a continuation of Clattenburg's 1999 film of the same title, premiered on Showcase in 2001. There are three films in the series: The Movie, released on October 6, 2006; Countdown to Liquor Day, released on September 25, 2009; and Don't Legalize It, released on April 18, 2014.
The seventh and final season of the series' original run on Showcase ended in 2007, with its final episode, "Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys", premiering as a one-hour special on December 7, 2008.
A few years later, Robb Wells, John Paul Tremblay, and Mike Smith, the actors who portrayed Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles, purchased the rights to the show from the original producers and created their own internet streaming network, "Swearnet". In March 2014, Swearnet began co-producing new seasons of the show, partnering with the streaming service Netflix to produce an eighth and ninth season, as well as three new specials. Season 8 premiered on September 5, 2014, followed by Season 9 on March 27, 2015.
Later that year, the show received the green light for two more seasons and began production on Season 10. During that time, the Canadian government granted the cast and crew money to help produce the new season and a new spin-off series. Season 10 premiered on Netflix on March 28, 2016.A new 8-part series, Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: Europe, became available for streaming on Netflix on October 28, 2016. A vlog series on Swearnet called State of the Union confirmed a second season taking place in the United States. Titled Trailer Park Boys: Out of the Park: USA, it premiered on Netflix on November 24, 2017.
Season 11 premiered on March 31, 2017. On June 19, 2017, the cast confirmed that the twelfth season had been greenlit and that filming had begun. Season 12 premiered on Netflix on March 30, 2018. Further production has not been renewed, but future seasons have not been ruled out of the question. As of August, 2018, Season 13 is rumored to be in production. However, due to the fact that actor John Dunsworth, who played Jim Lahey on the show, passed away in October 2017 at the age of 71, the shows status is currently unconfirmed, and is possibly in a hiatus, although all previous series are still popular on Netflix.
