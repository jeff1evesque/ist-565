Halloween is an American horror franchise that consists of ten films, novels, comic books, merchandise, and a video game. The franchise primarily focuses on serial killer Michael Myers who was committed to a sanitarium as a child for the murder of his older sister, Judith Myers. Fifteen years later, he escapes to stalk and kill the people of the fictional town of Haddonfield, Illinois while being chased by his former psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis. Michael's killings occur on the holiday of Halloween, on which all of the films primarily take place.
The original Halloween, released in 1978, was written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, and directed by Carpenter. The film is known to have inspired a long line of slasher films.
Seven sequels have since followed. Michael Myers is the antagonist in all of the films except Halloween III: Season of the Witch, the story of which has no direct connection to any other film in the series. In 2007, writer-director Rob Zombie made a remake of the 1978 film. A direct sequel to the 2007 remake was released two years later.
The films collectively grossed over $366 million at the box-office worldwide. The film series is ranked fourth at the United States box office—in adjusted 2008 dollars—when compared to other American horror franchises.
