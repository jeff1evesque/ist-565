The Morocco national football team, nicknamed "Lions of the Atlas" (Arabic: أسود الأطلس‎ / Irzem n Atlasi), is the national team of Morocco. It is currently managed by Hervé Renard.
Winners of the African Nations Cup in 1976, they were the first African team to win a group at the World Cup, which they did in 1986, finishing ahead of Portugal, Poland, and England. They were also the first African team to make it to the second round, barely losing to eventual runners-up West Germany 1–0 in 1986. They also came within two minutes of moving out of the group stage of the 1998 World Cup, Kjetil Rekdal's late winning goal for Norway against Brazil eliminating them.
Morocco qualified for the 2018 World Cup, making it their first first time in 20 years.
