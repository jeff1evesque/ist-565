Liberty National is a country club in Jersey City, New Jersey. Its clubhouse, guest villas, teaching super center, and halfway house referred to as "Cafe 12" were designed by Lindsay Newman Architecture and Design and with a 7,353-yard (6,724 m) course designed by Robert E. Cupp and Tom Kite.The club cost over $250 million to build, making it one of the most expensive golf courses in history. Club designers added amenities such as an on-site helistop, yacht services, spa, and restaurant. Nine hundred adjacent homes, slated to be built in the coming years, are projected to cost $1.5 to $5 million. Liberty National is noted as a unique course because of its proximity to both the Statue of Liberty and Manhattan, as well as having been built on a former landfill.
