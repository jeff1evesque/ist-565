The Lesser Sunda Islands (Indonesian: Kepulauan Nusa Tenggara "southeastern archipelago" 
or Kepulauan Sunda Kecil "lesser Sundanese archipelago") 
are a group of islands in Maritime Southeast Asia, north of Australia. Together with the Greater Sunda Islands to the west they make up the Sunda Islands.  The islands are part of a volcanic arc, the Sunda Arc, formed by subduction along the Sunda Trench in the Java Sea.
The main Lesser Sunda Islands are, from west to east: Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sumba, Timor, Alor archipelago, Barat Daya Islands, and Tanimbar Islands.
