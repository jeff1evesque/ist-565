This is a list of episodes of the Pokémon animated series (ポケットモンスター Poketto Monsutā, Pocket Monsters). The division between seasons of Pokémon is based on the English version openings of each episode and may not reflect the actual production season. The English episode numbers are based on their first airing either in syndication, on the WB Television Network, Cartoon Network, or on Disney XD. Subsequent episodes of the English version follow the original Japanese order, except where banned episodes are shown.
