The NBA salary  cap is the limit to the total amount of money that National Basketball Association teams are allowed to pay their players. Like many professional sports leagues, the NBA has a salary cap to control costs and benefit parity, defined by the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA). This limit is subject to a complex system of rules and exceptions and as such is considered a soft cap and is calculated as a percentage of the league's revenue from the previous season. Under the CBA ratified in December 2011, the cap will continue to vary in future seasons based on league revenues. For the 2015–16 season, the salary cap was $70 million and the luxury tax limit was $84.74 million. For the 2016–17 season, the salary cap was set at $94.14 million and the luxury tax limit was $113.29 million. For the 2017–18 season, the cap is set at $99 million for the salary cap and $119 million for the luxury tax.
