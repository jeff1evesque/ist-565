Executive orders issued by Presidents of the United States to help officers and agencies of the executive branch manage operations within the government.
At the federal level of government in the United States, laws are made almost exclusively by legislation.  Such legislation originates as an Act of Congress passed by the United States Congress; such acts were either signed into law by the President or passed by Congress after a presidential veto.
However, legislation is not the only source of regulations. There is also judge-made common law and constitutional law. The President can issue executive orders pursuant to a grant of discretion from Congress, or under the inherent powers that office holds to deal with certain matters which have the force of law.
Many early executive orders were not recorded.  The State Department began numbering executive orders in the early 20th century, starting retroactively from President Abraham Lincoln's Executive Order Establishing a Provisional Court in Louisiana issued in 1862.
