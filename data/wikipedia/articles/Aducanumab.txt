Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody that is being studied for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is being developed by Biogen Inc., which licensed the drug candidate from Neurimmune, its discoverer. The antibody targets aggregated forms of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the hopes of reducing its buildup.
