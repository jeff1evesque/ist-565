Joyce Carol Vincent (19 October 1965 â€“ c. December 2003) was a British woman whose death went unnoticed for more than two years as her corpse lay undiscovered in her London bedsit. Prior to her death, Vincent had cut off nearly all contact with those who knew her. She resigned from her job in 2001, and moved into a shelter for victims of domestic abuse. Around the same time, she began to reduce contact with friends and family. She died in her bedsit around December 2003 with neither family, co-workers, nor neighbours taking notice. Her remains were discovered on 25 January 2006, with the cause of death believed to be either an asthma attack or complications from a recent peptic ulcer.
Her life and death were the topic of Dreams of a Life, a 2011 drama-documentary film. The film and Vincent's life inspired the album Hand. Cannot. Erase. by musician Steven Wilson.
