RuPay is an Indian domestic card scheme conceived and launched by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) on 26 March 2012. It was created to fulfil the Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s (RBI) desire to have a domestic, open loop, and multilateral system of payments in India. In India, 90% of credit card transactions and almost all debit card transactions are domestic; however, the cost of transactions was high due to monopoly of foreign gateways like Visa and Mastercard. RuPay facilitates electronic payment at all Indian banks and financial institutions. NPCI maintains ties with Discover Financial to enable the card scheme to gain international acceptance.
