In psychology, Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) is a questionnaire to assess the personality traits of a person, this is not the same questionnaire as the Eysenck's personality Inventory or EPI which was an earlier instrument also produced by Hans Eysenck.
It was devised by the psychologists Hans JÃ¼rgen Eysenck and Sybil B. G. Eysenck.Hans Eysenck's theory is based primarily on physiology and genetics. Although he was a behaviorist who considered learned habits of great importance, he believed that personality differences grow out of our genetic inheritance. He is, therefore, primarily interested in what is usually called temperament.
Temperament is that aspect of our personalities that is genetically based, and present from birth or even before. In devising a temperament-based theory Eysenck did not exclude the possibility that some aspects of personality are learned, but left the consideration of these to other researchers.
