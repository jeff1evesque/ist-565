WrestleMania 32 was the thirty-second annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event produced by WWE. It took place on April 3, 2016, at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.Twelve matches were contested at the event (including three matches on the pre-show). Four matches were particularly considered to be the marquee attractions. In the main event, Roman Reigns defeated Triple H to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, while Shane McMahon (in his first match since 2009) lost to The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match, Brock Lesnar defeated Dean Ambrose in a No Holds Barred Street Fight, and Charlotte won the newly instated WWE Women's Championship (which replaced the retired Divas Championship) in a triple threat match over Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks. The event was also notable for having the shortest WrestleMania match ever, when The Rock beat Erick Rowan, in an impromptu match, the unannounced appearance of John Cena, and the Andr√© the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which included the surprise participation of NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal and was won by NXT call-up Baron Corbin in his main roster debut.
According to WWE, WrestleMania 32 set multiple records for the company; including grossing $17.3 million and a claimed attendance record of 101,763. Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer disputed WWE's attendance figure, claiming an attendance of 93,730 which still would have been a WWE record. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon later admitted the attendance record "wasn't 101,000 paid" as it included "ushers and ticket takers and all of that".Despite its commercial success, critics gave mixed reviews for WrestleMania 32 and rated it worse than the NXT TakeOver: Dallas event WWE held two days prior. The main event title match drew criticism and also resulted in negative and angry crowd reactions.
