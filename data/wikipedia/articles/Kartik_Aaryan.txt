Kartik Aaryan (born Kartik Tiwari on 22 November 1990) is an Indian actor who appears in Hindi films. Born and raised in Gwalior, he relocated to Navi Mumbai to pursue an engineering degree in biotechnology. He simultaneously dabbled in modelling and made attempts to start a career in film. After struggling for three years, Aaryan made his acting debut in 2011 with Pyaar Ka Punchnama, a buddy film about the romantic tribulations faced by three young men, which was directed by Luv Ranjan and co-starred Nushrat Bharucha.
Aaryan went on to play the romantic interest of the lead female characters in Akaash Vani (2013) and Kaanchi: The Unbreakable (2014), but the films did not perform well commercially. He subsequently collaborated with Ranjan and Bharucha in two more buddy films, Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 (2015) and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety (2018). Critics accused these films of misogyny but they were both financial successes. The latter emerged as one of the highest-grossing Indian films of 2018 and proved to be a breakthrough for Aaryan.
