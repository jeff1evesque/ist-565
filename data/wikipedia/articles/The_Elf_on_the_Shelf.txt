The Elf on the Shelf: A Christmas Tradition  is a 2005 children's picture book, written by Carol Aebersold and her daughter Chanda Bell, and illustrated by CoÃ« Steinwart. The book tells a Christmas-themed story, written in rhyme, that explains how Santa Claus knows who is naughty and nice. It describes elves visiting children between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, after which they return to the North Pole until the next holiday season. The Elf on the Shelf comes in a keepsake box that features a hardbound picture book and a small soft toy in the form of a pixie scout elf.
