Oliver Dragojević (7 December 1947 Vela Luka – 29 July 2018 Split) was a Croatian recording artist, who was considered one of the most enduring musical stars and cultural icons in Croatia with a discography that spans over nearly four decades. His style blended traditional klapa melodies of Dalmatia, a coastal region in his native Croatia, with jazz motifs wrapped up in a modern production. He is one of the few Croatian musicians who performed at major international venues such as Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall, L'Olympia and Sydney Opera House.
