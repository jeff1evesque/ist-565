The White Princess is a 2017 British-American historical fiction television series for Starz, based on Philippa Gregory's 2013 novel of the same name and, to a lesser extent, its sequel The King's Curse. It is a sequel to The White Queen, a 2013 BBC-produced miniseries adapting three of Gregory's previous novels.
In the eight episode series, the marriage of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York effectively ends the Wars of the Roses by uniting the houses of Lancaster and York. However, their mutual enmity and distrust—as well as the political plots of their mothers—threaten to tear both the marriage and the kingdom apart.
