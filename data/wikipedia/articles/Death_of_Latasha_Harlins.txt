Latasha Harlins (July 14, 1975 – March 16, 1991) was a 15-year-old American girl who was shot in the head by Soon Ja Du (Hangul:두순자), a 51-year-old female convenience store owner from South Korea, who was tried and convicted of voluntary manslaughter in Harlins' death. Harlins was a student at Westchester High School in Los Angeles. Harlins' death came 13 days after the videotaped beating of Rodney King. Du was fined $500 and sentenced to five years of probation and 400 hours of community service but no prison time for her crime. Some have cited the shooting of Latasha Harlins as one of the causes of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
