Kombucha (also tea mushroom, Manchurian mushroom, formal name: Medusomyces gisevii) is a variety of fermented, lightly effervescent sweetened black or green tea drinks commonly intended as functional beverages for their supposed health benefits. Kombucha is produced by fermenting tea using a "symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast" (SCOBY). Microbial populations in SCOBY cultures vary. The yeast component generally includes Saccharomyces c. and other species and the bacterial component almost always includes Gluconacetobacter xylinus to oxidize yeast-produced alcohols to acetic and other acids.Numerous claims of health benefits have been made from drinking kombucha, but there is no scientific evidence to support this view. There have been rare cases of serious adverse effects, including fatalities, from the beverage, possibly arising from contamination during home preparation. Drinking kombucha is not recommended for therapeutic use because its benefits are unverified and do not outweigh the possible risks.The exact origins of kombucha are not known. It is thought to have originated in the area of Northeastern China and was traditionally consumed in that region, Russia, and eastern Europe. Kombucha is home-brewed globally and some companies sell it commercially.
