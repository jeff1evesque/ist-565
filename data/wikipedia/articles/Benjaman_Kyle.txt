"Benjaman Kyle" was the alias chosen by an American man who has severe dissociative amnesia after he was found without clothing or identification and with injuries next to a dumpster behind a fast food restaurant in Georgia in 2004. As a result of his lack of personal memories, between 2004 and 2015, neither he nor the authorities were sure of his real identity or background, despite searches that used widespread television show-based publicity and various other methods. 
In late 2015, genetic detective work which had gone on for years finally led to the discovery of his real name, William Burgess Powell, although part of his missing years' history still remains untraceable. He also no longer has to rely on jobs that pay under the table and can collect public assistance with the rediscovery of his Social Security number.
