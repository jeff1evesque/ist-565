Stuyvesant High School (pronounced ) commonly referred to as Stuy (pronounced ) is a specialized high school in New York City, United States. Operated by the New York City Department of Education, these specialized schools offer tuition-free accelerated academics to city residents. Stuyvesant is a college-preparatory high school.
Stuyvesant was established as an all-boys school in the East Village in 1904. An entrance examination was mandated for all applicants starting in 1934, and the school started accepting female students in 1969. Stuyvesant moved to its current location at Battery Park City in 1992 because the school had become too large. The old building now houses several high schools.
Admission to Stuyvesant involves passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. Each November, about 30,000 eighth- and ninth-grade students take the three-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. Approximately 900 to 950 applicants are accepted to Stuyvesant each year. The school has a wide range of extracurricular activities, including two student publications and a theater competition called SING!. Notable alumni have included mathematician Paul Cohen, string theorist Brian Greene, physicist Lisa Randall, and genomic researcher Eric Lander.
