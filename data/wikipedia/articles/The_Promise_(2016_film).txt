The Promise is a 2016 American historical drama film directed by Terry George and starring Oscar Isaac, Charlotte Le Bon and Christian Bale, set in the final years of the Ottoman Empire. The plot is about a love triangle that develops between Mikael (Isaac), an Armenian medical student, Chris (Bale), a Paris-based American journalist, and Ana (Le Bon), an Armenian-born woman raised in France, immediately before the Armenian Genocide.
The Promise premiered on September 11, 2016, at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released in the United States on April 21, 2017, 102 years to the week of the Genocide, by Open Road Films. The film was a box office bomb, grossing just $12 million against its $90 million budget and losing the studio over $100 million, although the studio noted the main purpose of the film was to bring attention to the story, not make money.
