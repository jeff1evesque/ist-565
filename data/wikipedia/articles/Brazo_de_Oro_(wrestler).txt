Jesús Alvarado Nieves ([xeˈsus a̠l.β̞a̠ˈɾa̠.ð̞o̞ ˈnjeβ̞es] October 7, 1959 – April 28, 2017) was a Mexican luchador, or professional wrestler, who worked under the ring name Brazo de Oro ([ˈbɾa̠.so̞ ð̞e̞ ˈo.ɾo] Spanish for "Golden Arm"). He was a part of the Alvarado wrestling family, the son of Shadito Cruz and brother of Brazo de Plata, El Brazo, Brazo Cibernético, Super Brazo and Brazo de Platino. His son Felipe de Jesús Alvarado Mendoza currently works as La Máscara for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. His nephews, Máximo Sexy and Psycho Clown are featured wrestlers for CMLL and Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide respectively.
Alvarado made his debut in 1975 and for over a decade wrestled under a wrestling mask, until he and his brothers Brazo de Plata and El Brazo lost a Lucha de Apuestas match to Los Villanos in 1988 and was forced to unmask. Over the years he has teamed with his brothers to win various championships such as the CMLL World Trios Championship, Mexican National Tag Team Championship, Mexican National Trios Championship, NWA Americas Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship (Los Angeles version), UWA World Tag Team Championship, UWA World Trios Championship, WWA World Tag Team Championship and WWA World Trios Championship. He started focusing more on behind the scenes activities in the early 1990s, where he worked as one of the bookers for CMLL and served as the head of the wrestlers' union for many years.
