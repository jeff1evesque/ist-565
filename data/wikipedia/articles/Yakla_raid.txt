The Raid on Yakla, or simply 2017 Yemen raid, was a United States-led Special Operations Forces operation carried out on January 29, 2017 in al-Ghayil, a village in the Yakla area of the Al Bayda province in central Yemen, during the Second Yemeni Civil War. Authorized by President Donald Trump, its goal was to gather intelligence on al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and also, as claimed by unnamed sources, targeted the group's leader, Qasim al-Raymi. The operation, the first high level counter-terrorism raid authorized by Trump, did not follow the rigorous planning procedures of the prior two administrations. United States Central Command (CENTCOM) was involved with the Special Operations Command, which oversees global counter-terrorism military operations, and the CIA.One DEVGRU operator was killed and three other DEVGRU operators were wounded in the raid. Between 10 and 30 civilians, including the eight-year-old American daughter of the deceased Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, were also killed in the raid along with up to 14 enemy combatants. A Bell Boeing MV-22B Osprey was destroyed during the operation.The raid in Yemen was described as "risky from the start and costly in the end"; the "botched" operation raised questions about the choice to go forward with the raid "without sufficient intelligence, ground support or adequate backup preparations".
