The 2017 William Hill World Darts Championship was the 24th World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation. The event took place at Alexandra Palace in London from 15 December 2016 to 2 January 2017.
Phil Taylor made a 28th successive appearance at a World Championship (including the BDO version), equalling the record of John Lowe.
For the first time in the history of the World Darts Championship (PDC and BDO), no Englishman progressed to the semi-finals. It was also the first time since 2009 that the final was contested by the top 2 seeds.
Michael van Gerwen set a new record for the highest World Darts Championship 3-dart average (114.05) in his semi-final victory over Raymond van Barneveld, breaking a 15-year record that had been held by Phil Taylor since the 2002 edition (111.21); van Barneveld himself set a new record for the highest losing 3-dart average (109.34) in the same fixture, just 5 days after Cristo Reyes had broken the record in his second round match (106.07), also against van Gerwen.
Van Gerwen won his second World Championship title by defeating two-times defending champion Gary Anderson 7â€“3 in the final.
