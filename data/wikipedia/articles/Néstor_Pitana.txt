Néstor Fabián Pitana (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈnestoɾ piˈtana]; born 17 June 1975) is an Argentine football referee and former actor who refereed at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2015 Copa América and 2018 FIFA World Cup. He oversaw the opening match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Pitana was appointed to take charge of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final between France and Croatia at Moscow on 15 July 2018. He became the second Argentine referee to take charge of a World Cup Final (after Horacio Elizondo, who did the same in 2006). Pitana's performance in the Final has seen some controversy, mostly related to the use of VAR. France's first goal was scored from a free kick which was seen by many as a dive from Griezmann (however, the current rules related to VAR forbade intervention in the case). France's second goal was scored from a penalty given after Pitana was informed by VAR that he may wish to review the recording of Perišić's handball. After a lengthily deliberation and indecisiveness, Pitana awarded the penalty to France, which many pundits called an incorrect interpretation of the rules, which steered the game into France's favor.
