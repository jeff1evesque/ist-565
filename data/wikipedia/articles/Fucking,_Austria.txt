Fucking (German: [ˈfʊkɪŋ] ( listen)) is an Austrian village in the municipality of Tarsdorf, in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria. The village is 33 kilometres (21 mi) north of Salzburg, 4 km (2.5 mi) east of the Inn river, which forms the German border.
Despite having a population of only 104 in 2005, the village has drawn attention for its unusual place name in the English-speaking world.  Its road signs are a popular visitor attraction, and they were often stolen by souvenir-hunting vandals until 2005, when the signs were modified to be theft-resistant.
