Henri Paul (3 July 1956 – 31 August 1997) was the driver of the Mercedes S280 in which Diana, Princess of Wales, died on 31 August 1997. As Deputy Head of Security at the Hôtel Ritz Paris, Paul had been off duty that evening but was called back to drive Diana and Dodi Fayed to their apartment. The car crashed at high speed in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel, with only bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones surviving. 
There have been many conspiracy theories surrounding the car crash. British and French police investigations put the blame largely on Paul for being affected by alcohol and prescription drugs, and later driving recklessly.
