A cat organ or cat piano (German: Katzenorgel or Katzenklavier, French: orgue à chats or piano à chats/piano chats) is a hypothetical musical instrument which consists of a line of cats fixed in place with their tails stretched out underneath a keyboard so that they cry out when a key is pressed. The cats would be arranged according to the natural tone of their voices.
