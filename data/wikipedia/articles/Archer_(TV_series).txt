Archer is an American adult animated sitcom created by Adam Reed for the basic cable network FX. It follows the exploits of a dysfunctional group of secret agents—Sterling Archer (voiced by H. Jon Benjamin) and seven of his colleagues—Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), Cheryl Tunt (Judy Greer), Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), Ray Gillette (Reed), Cyril Figgis (Chris Parnell) and Dr. Algernop Krieger (Lucky Yates). The premise of Archer evolves in subsequent seasons as the show experiments with the standard setup of an anthology, each with self-contained arcs, new settings, a disparate set of personae for each character, even distinct humor. Beginning with the eighth season in 2017, the series moved to the FXX network.
Archer was conceived by Reed shortly after the cancellation of his Adult Swim comedy Frisky Dingo. It draws inspiration from a variety of sources, including the James Bond franchise. The show's hallmarks include reference-heavy humor, rapid-fire dialogue, and meta-comedy. Archer is produced using limited animation and takes its visual style from mid-century comic art. The cast members record their lines individually, and the show regularly employs guest actors and actresses for supporting characters. There have been 101 episodes broadcast in the show's history.
Archer has received positive reviews from critics and won awards, including three Primetime Emmy Awards and four Critics Choice Awards. The series has also received 15 Annie Award nominations, among others, for outstanding achievement in animation, writing, direction, and voice acting. At San Diego Comic Con 2018, it was announced the tenth season will be titled Archer: 1999. Reed intends to leave Archer after its tenth season, although plans have not yet been finalized for the show's future.
