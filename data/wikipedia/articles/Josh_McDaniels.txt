Joshua Thomas McDaniels (born April 22, 1976) is an American football coach who is the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach of the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). McDaniels has been one of the few members of the Patriots' coaching staff that has been there for all five of their Super Bowl wins; he was with the team initially from 2001 to 2008, serving in multiple capacities. 
In 2009, McDaniels was hired as the head coach of the Denver Broncos. At the time of his hiring, 33-year-old McDaniels was the youngest head coach in the NFL, although less than a week later the Tampa Bay Buccaneers named Raheem Morris, who is five months younger, as their head coach. McDaniels was fired by Denver after a 3â€“9 start in 2010. He spent the 2011 season as offensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams, but he was released by the Rams for the 2011 playoffs to serve as an offensive assistant for the Patriots in their run to Super Bowl XLVI, before returning to the team as offensive coordinator that following season.
