Garry Hoy (January 1, 1955 â€“ July 9, 1993) was a lawyer for the law firm of Holden Day Wilson in Toronto notorious for how he died. In an attempt to prove to a group of prospective articling students that the glass windows of the Toronto-Dominion Centre were unbreakable, Hoy threw himself at a glass wall on the 24th storey and fell to his death after the window frame gave way.
