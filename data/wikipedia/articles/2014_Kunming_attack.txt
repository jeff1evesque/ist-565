At around 9:20 p.m., a group of eight knife-wielding men and women attacked passengers at the city's railway station. Both male and female attackers pulled out long-bladed knives and stabbed and slashed passengers. At the scene, police killed four assailants and captured one injured female. The incident, targeted against civilians, left 31 civilians and 4 perpetrators dead with more than 140 others injured. In the afternoon of 3 March, police announced that the six-man, two-woman group had been neutralized after the arrest of three remaining suspects.No group or individual stepped forward to claim responsibility for the attack. Xinhua News Agency and the government of Kunming said the attack had been linked to Xinjiang separatist terrorists, with Time and The New York Times also reporting that members of Xinjiang`s Uyghur Muslim community were involved in the attack.  Police said they had confiscated a black, hand-painted East Turkestan flag, associated with the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region for which the separatists seek independence, at the scene of the attack.
