Jack Andrew Lowden (born 2 June 1990) is a Scottish actor. Following a highly successful and award-winning four-year stage career, his first major international onscreen success was in the 2016 BBC miniseries War & Peace, which led to starring roles in feature films.
Lowden starred as Eric Liddell in the 2012 play Chariots of Fire in London. In 2014 he won an Olivier Award and the Ian Charleson Award for his role as Oswald in Richard Eyre's 2013 adaptation of Ibsen's Ghosts. Also in 2014, Screen Daily named him one of the UK Stars of Tomorrow.
Since 2013 he has been in British television series and feature films, including substantial roles in The Tunnel (2013) and '71 (2014), and leading roles in the BBC miniseries The Passing Bells (2014) and War & Peace (2016). His subsequent film projects have included the title role as golfing legend Tommy Morris in Tommy's Honour (2016), the starring role of Morrissey in the biopic England Is Mine (2017), a main-cast role as an RAF fighter-pilot in Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk (2017), and a starring role in the Scottish Highlands thriller Calibre (2018).
In late 2016 the UK arts and entertainment magazine The List chose Lowden as one of The Hot 100 2016.
