The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest is an annual American hot dog competitive eating competition. It is held each year on Independence Day at Nathan's Famous Corporation's original, and best-known restaurant at the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues in Coney Island, a  neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City.
The contest has gained public attention in recent years due to the stardom of Takeru Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut. The defending men's champion is Joey Chestnut, who ate 74 hot dogs in the 2018 contest. The defending women's champion is Miki Sudo, who ate 37 hot dogs in the 2018 contest.
