Grant Henry Hill (born October 5, 1972) is an American former basketball player. He is currently a host of NBA TV's NBA Inside Stuff. Hill played for four teams in his professional career in the National Basketball Association (NBA); the Detroit Pistons, Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns, and Los Angeles Clippers.
Hill's parents are retired NFL Pro Bowl running back Calvin Hill and Janet Hill. He and his father were Rookies of the Year in their respective sports; Hill in the NBA in 1995 (shared with Jason Kidd), and his father in the NFL with the Dallas Cowboys in 1969.
While playing college basketball at Duke, he was the 1994 ACC Player of the Year, a two-time NCAA All-American, and a two-time NCAA champion.  As a professional he was the 1995 NBA co-Rookie of the Year, and was a seven-time NBA All-Star, five-time All-NBA selection, and three-time winner of the NBA Sportsmanship Award.
Throughout his college career and early in his years with the Detroit Pistons, Hill was widely considered to be one of the best all-around players in the game, often leading his team in points, rebounds and assists. Touted as one of the best players in Duke history, many went as far as to say that he was one of the greatest collegiate basketball players in his era. After his first six seasons with the Pistons, in which he averaged 21.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 6.3 assists, his next twelve seasons were mostly injury plagued, as he averaged just 13.1 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 2.6 assists per game. On June 1, 2013, after 19 years in the league, Hill announced his retirement from the NBA. Hill and Tony Ressler officially purchased the Atlanta Hawks on June 24, 2015 for an estimated $730 million â€“ $850 million.
