Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, commonly referred to simply as Tottenham () or Spurs, is a professional football club in Tottenham, London, England, that competes in the Premier League. The club's home ground for the 2018–19 season will be Tottenham Hotspur Stadium but the club will play their first few home games of the season at Wembley Stadium. Their former home of White Hart Lane had been demolished to make way for the new stadium on the same site. Their training ground is on Hotspur Way in Bulls Cross in the London Borough of Enfield.
Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, the only non-League club to do so since the formation of the Football League in 1888. Tottenham were the first club in the 20th century to achieve the League and FA Cup Double, winning both competitions in the 1960–61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, in 1963 they became the first British club to win a UEFA club competition – the European Cup Winners' Cup. They were also the inaugural winners of the UEFA Cup in 1972, becoming the first British club to win two different major European trophies. They have collected at least one major trophy in each of the six decades from the 1950s to 2000s – an achievement only matched by Manchester United. In total, Spurs have won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners' Cup and two UEFA Cups.
The club's Latin motto is Audere est Facere ("To Dare Is to Do"), and its emblem is a cockerel standing upon a football. The club has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, with head-to-head fixtures known as the North London derby.
