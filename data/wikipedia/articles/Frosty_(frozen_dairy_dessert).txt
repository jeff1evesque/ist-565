The Frosty is the signature frozen dairy dessert of Wendy's fast-food restaurants, introduced in 1969 when the first restaurant opened. The Frosty's original light chocolate flavor, actually a combination of chocolate and vanilla, was initially the only flavor offered. Wendy's founder Dave Thomas thought that a pure chocolate flavor would overwhelm the taste of the restaurant's hamburgers. In August 2006, a vanilla flavor was introduced after repeated consumer requests.
