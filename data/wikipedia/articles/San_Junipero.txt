"San Junipero" is the fourth episode in series three of British science fiction anthology series Black Mirror. Written by series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Owen Harris, it premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016, with the rest of series three. The episode has a substantially more hopeful tone than other Black Mirror stories; it garnered popularity among both fans and critics and received numerous awards.
The episode is set in a beach resort town named San Junipero, where an introverted Yorkie (Mackenzie Davis) meets the more outgoing Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). The town is a simulated reality the elderly can inhabit, even after death. "San Junipero" was the first episode written for series three of Black Mirror; initial drafts were based on nostalgia therapy and designed as a 1980s period piece, featuring a heterosexual couple and an unhappy ending. Filming took place in London and Cape Town across a few weeks. The soundtrack interweaves 1980s songs with an original score by Clint Mansell.
The episode has received critical acclaim, with generally higher ratings than the show's other episodes. Some critics believed it to be one of the best television episodes of 2016. In addition to several other accolades, "San Junipero" won two Primetime Emmy Awards in the Television Movie and Writing for a Limited Series, Movie, or Dramatic Special categories. Mbatha-Raw's and Davis's performances were very well-received and the episode's plot twist was widely praised, along with the uplifting tone of the episode and its visual style.
