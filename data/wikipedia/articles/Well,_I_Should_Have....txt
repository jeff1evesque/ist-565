Well, I Should Have... (subtitled Learned How To Play Piano) is an experimental jazz album by American comedy actor H. Jon Benjamin. It was released on November 27, 2015 on the Sub Pop label. The album was intentionally recorded to sound bad, since, as the album's title indicates, Benjamin does not know how to play piano, but still does so on the album, and Benjamin has never liked jazz very much.Guests who appear on the album include Aziz Ansari and Kristen Schaal. The album also features actual jazz musicians such as Scott Kreitzer (saxophone), David Finck (bass), and Jonathan Peretz (drums). Every song on the album but one was mixed by Mark Desimone; the only song he did not mix was mixed by Bob's Burgers creator Loren Bouchard.
