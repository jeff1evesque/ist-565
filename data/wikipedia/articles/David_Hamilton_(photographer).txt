David Hamilton (15 April 1933 â€“ 25 November 2016) was a British photographer and film director best known for his photography of young women and underage girls, mostly in the nude. His signature soft focus style was called the "Hamilton Blur", which was achieved by smearing Vaseline on the lens of his camera. Hamilton's images became part of an "art or pornography" debate.
In October 2016, French presenter Flavie Flament accused him of raping her in 1987, when she was 13 years old. In November 2016, French magazine L'Obs published anonymous accounts from three other former models claiming to have been raped by Hamilton. Hamilton issued a statement threatening legal action against his accusers and affirmed that he didn't do anything wrong. On 25 November 2016, he was found dead in his Paris apartment by apparent suicide.
