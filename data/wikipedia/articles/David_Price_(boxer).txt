David Price (born 6 July 1983) is a British professional boxer. He held the British, English, and Commonwealth heavyweight titles between 2012 and 2013, and was one of the division's top-rated prospects in the early 2010s until several knockout losses derailed his career. As an amateur he won a bronze medal at the 2008 Olympics, gold at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and 2008 EU Championships, and three ABA titles; all in the super-heavyweight division.
