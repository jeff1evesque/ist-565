Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is a 1995 American slasher film directed by Joe Chappelle, written by Daniel Farrands. The film stars Donald Pleasence in his final film appearance. The film also features Paul Rudd, and Marianne Hagan. The sixth installment in the Halloween film series, it follows a young woman living with her family in Michael Myers's childhood home who finds herself stalked by Myers on Halloween. At her aid is Tommy Doyle, a returning character from the original Halloween film, and Dr. Sam Loomis. The plot of the film formally introduced the "Curse of Thorn", a mystical symbol first referenced in The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) and revealed in the film to be the source of Michael Myers's immortality and drive to kill.Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers was released almost six years after their previous Halloween film, making it one of the longest gaps in the franchise. Shot in Salt Lake City in the winter of 1994–95, the film underwent a series of reshoots after it performed poorly with test audiences, resulting in a final product that was significantly different—both tonally and narratively—from the original script. The film was distributed by Miramax's Dimension Films, and opened in the fall of 1995, earning $7.3 million during its opening weekend, coming in second to the New Line Cinema thriller Seven. Notably, Donald Pleasence died nearly eight months before the film was released. The film was dedicated to the memory of Pleasence.
After the film's home media release, the original workprint of the film (which featured 43 minutes of alternative footage and an alternate ending) was discovered by fans of the series. This version, dubbed The Producer's Cut, developed a cult following, with bootleg DVD copies sold on eBay and online petitions targeting for an official release of it. In 2014, The Producer's Cut was officially released on Blu-ray.
