Rossa Matilda Richter (1863â€“8 December 1937) was an English aerialist and actor who became the first human cannonball at the age of 14. She began performing at a very young age, practicing aerial stunts like tightrope walking in an old London church. In 1877, using the stage name Zazel, she was the first person to be fired out of a cannon, in front of a large crowd at the Royal Aquarium. She later toured Europe and North America with circuses including Barnum & Bailey, executing tightrope, trapeze, and high dive routines in addition to the human cannonball. Outside of the circus, she volunteered time to writing and holding exhibitions to promote the life-saving potential for safety nets. Throughout her career, she suffered several accidents and injuries, the most serious of which largely ended her career in 1891.
