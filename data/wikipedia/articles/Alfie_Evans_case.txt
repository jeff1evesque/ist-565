The Alfie Evans case was a legal case in 2018 involving Alfie Evans (9 May 2016 â€“ 28 April 2018), an infant boy from Liverpool with an undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder.The medical team and the child's parents disagreed about whether to maintain Evans' life support or to withdraw it, resulting in a legal battle. Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust sought a declaration that continued ventilatory support was "unkind and inhumane", and not in Evans' best interests. Alfie's parents, Kate James and Thomas Evans, contested the application.
The ventilatory support was removed on 23 April 2018 following a series of unsuccessful appeals from Alfie's family. Alfie continued to breathe naturally after the removal of his breathing tube. He died at 2:30 a.m. on 28 April 2018.
