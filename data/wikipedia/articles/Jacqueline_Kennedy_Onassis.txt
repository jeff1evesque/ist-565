Jacqueline Lee Kennedy Onassis (née Bouvier ; July 28, 1929 – May 19, 1994) was an American book editor and socialite who was First Lady of the United States during the presidency of her husband, John F. Kennedy, from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963.
Bouvier was born in Southampton, New York to Wall Street stockbroker John Vernour Bouvier III and his wife, Janet Lee Bouvier, in 1929.  In 1951, she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in French literature from George Washington University and went on to work for the Washington Times-Herald as an inquiring photographer.In 1952, Bouvier met then-Congressman John F. Kennedy at a dinner party in Washington.  Following his election to the Senate in 1952, the couple married on September 12, 1953 in Newport, Rhode Island. They had four children, two of whom died in infancy.  Following her husband's election to the presidency in 1960, Jacqueline Kennedy was known for her highly-publicized restoration of the White House and emphasis on arts and culture, as well as for her style, elegance, and grace.  Only 31 years old when her husband was inaugurated, she was the youngest First Lady since Frances Cleveland.  She was also the first Catholic to serve as First Lady.On November 22, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy was riding with the President in an open-air motorcade in Dallas, Texas when he was assassinated.  Following his funeral, she and her children largely withdrew from public view.  In 1968, she married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis.  Following Aristotle Onassis's death in 1975, she had a career as a publishing editor in New York City.  She died on May 19, 1994 of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, aged 64.
During her lifetime, Jacqueline Kennedy was regarded as an international fashion icon.  Her famous ensemble of a pink Chanel suit and matching pillbox hat has become a symbol of her husband's assassination.  Even after her death, she ranks as one of the most popular and recognizable First Ladies and was listed as one of Gallup's Most-Admired Men and Women of the 20th century in 1999.
