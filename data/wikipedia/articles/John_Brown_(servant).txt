John Brown (8 December 1826 â€“ 27 March 1883) was a Scottish personal attendant and favourite of Queen Victoria for many years. He was appreciated by many (including the Queen) for his competence and companionship, and resented by others for his influence and informal manner. The exact nature of his relationship with Victoria was the subject of great speculation by contemporaries and continues to be controversial today.
