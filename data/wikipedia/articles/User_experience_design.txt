User experience design (UX, UXD, UED or XD) is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product. User experience design encompasses traditional humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) design, and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.
