Metal Gear Survive is an action-adventure survival game developed and published by Konami. It was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2018. It is the first Metal Gear game to be developed following the series' creator Hideo Kojima's departure from Konami in late 2015, and the first since Snake's Revenge without Kojima's input. The game takes place in the time period between Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and follows a soldier of Big Boss' who enters a parallel dimension and joins forces with a local command center in order to unravel the mysteries of a strange virus that turns people into zombie-like creatures.
Metal Gear Survive's announcement was met with a negative reception from Metal Gear fans, namely in response to Konami's recent controversial business decisions and Kojima's departure from the company, as well as frustration at its divergent genre and theme when compared to prior Metal Gear titles. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews; mostly positive responses were given to its gameplay, with its rewarding sense of progression in single-player and satisfaction from multiplayer and co-op receiving praise, however concern was expressed over some of the mechanics, with the majority of complaints being directed at the story, characters, and inclusion of microtransactions.
