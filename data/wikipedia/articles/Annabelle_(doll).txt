Annabelle is a Raggedy Ann doll alleged by demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren to be haunted. The doll resides in a glass box at The Warrens' Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut. The story served as the inspiration for the films Annabelle (2014) and Annabelle: Creation (2017). Annabelle has been compared to Robert the Doll and was described in Gerald Brittle's 2002 biography of Ed and Lorraine Warren, The Demonologist.
