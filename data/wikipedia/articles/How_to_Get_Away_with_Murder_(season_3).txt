The third season of the ABC American television drama series How to Get Away with Murder was ordered on March 3, 2016, by ABC. It began airing on September 22, 2016, with 15 episodes like the previous seasons and concluded on February 23, 2017. This was made in a deal with Viola Davis that the series would be a limited series with only 15 or 16 episodes per season.
