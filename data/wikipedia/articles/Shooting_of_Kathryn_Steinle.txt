On July 1, 2015, 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle, while walking with her father and a friend along Pier 14 in the Embarcadero district of San Francisco, was shot by Jose Inez Garcia Zarate, who claimed a gun had fired accidentally while he was picking it up; he claimed he had found the gun moments before, wrapped in cloth beneath the bench on which he was sitting. The shot ricocheted off the concrete deck of the pier striking the victim in the back. Steinle died two hours later in hospital as a result of her injuries. On November 30, 2017, after five days of deliberations, a jury acquitted Zarate of all murder and manslaughter charges, but convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm.The shooting elicited controversy and political debate over San Francisco's status as a sanctuary city, as Zarate is a Mexican national unlawfully residing in the United States.
Donald Trump, at the time a presidential candidate, cited Zarate in support of his proposal to deport criminal illegal immigrants living in the United States, and mentioned Steinle during his acceptance speech at the 2016 Republican National Convention.
