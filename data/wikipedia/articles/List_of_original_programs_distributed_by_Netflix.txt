Netflix is an American global on-demand Internet streaming media provider, that has distributed a number of original programs, including original series, specials (including stand-up comedy specials), miniseries, and documentaries and films. Netflix's original productions also include continuations of previously canceled series from other channels, as well as licensing or co-producing content from international broadcasters for exclusive broadcast in other territories, which is also branded in those regions as Netflix original content. Netflix previously produced content through Red Envelope Entertainment.
Netflix's first self-commissioned original content series House of Cards was released in 2013, and the company has dramatically grown its original content since that time. All programming, which is in English unless stated otherwise, is organized by its primary genre or format, and sorted by premiere date.
