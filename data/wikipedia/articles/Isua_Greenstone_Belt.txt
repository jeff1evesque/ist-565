The Isua Greenstone Belt is an Archean greenstone belt in southwestern Greenland. The belt is aged between 3.7 and 3.8 billion years. The belt contains variably metamorphosed mafic volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The occurrence of boninitic geochemical signatures, characterized by extreme depletion in trace elements that are not fluid mobile, offers evidence that plate tectonic processes in which lithic crust is melted may have been responsible for the creation of the belt.  Another theory posits that the belt formed via a process known as vertical plate tectonics.In 2016 melting snow revealed 3.7-billion-year-old stromatolite fossils, the oldest by several hundred million years thus far discovered on Earth. The discovery of complex stromatolite structures at Isua, formed from accreted biofilm layers so early in the history of the Earth suggests that life first evolved on Earth over 4 billion years ago.
