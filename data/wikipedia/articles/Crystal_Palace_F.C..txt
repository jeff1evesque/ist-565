Crystal Palace Football Club is a professional football club based in Selhurst, London, that plays in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. They were founded in 1905 at the famous Crystal Palace Exhibition building by the owners of the FA Cup Final stadium which was situated inside its historic grounds. Palace played their home games at the Cup Final venue until 1915 when they were forced to leave due to the First World War. In 1924, the club moved to their current home at Selhurst Park. 
Since 1964, Palace have mostly played in the top two leagues of English football. The club had a successful period in the top flight in the late 1980s and early 1990s and challenged for the English league title in the 1990â€“91 season, eventually finishing in third place, their highest league position to date. Palace were denied entry into European competition at the end of that season due to the partial UEFA ban on English clubs following the Heysel Stadium disaster. It was during this period that the club became founding members of the Premier League. Palace have reached the FA Cup final twice and finished runners-up to Manchester United on both occasions in 1990 and 2016. The club have also been second tier champions twice and hold the record for the most play-off wins for promotion to the top flight, winning the final four times. 
In 1973, Palace changed its traditional kit colours from claret and blue to the red and blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. Palace have a fierce rivalry with Brighton & Hove Albion, with whom they contest the M23 derby. They also share rivalries with fellow South London clubs Millwall and Charlton Athletic.
