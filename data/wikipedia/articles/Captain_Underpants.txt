Captain Underpants is a children's novel series by American author and illustrator Dav Pilkey. The series revolves around two fourth graders, George Beard and Harold Hutchins, living in Piqua, Ohio, and Captain Underpants, an aptly named superhero from one of the boys' homemade comic books, that accidentally becomes real when George and Harold hypnotize their ill-tempered principal, Mr. Krupp. Soon after, Mr. Krupp gains superpowers by drinking alien juices in the third book.
The series includes 12 books and three spin-offs, and won a Disney Adventures Kids' Choice Award on April 4, 2006. As of 2016, the series had been translated into over 20 languages, with more than 70 million books sold worldwide, including over 50 million in the United States. DreamWorks Animation acquired rights to the series to make an animated feature film adaptation, which was released on June 2, 2017 to positive reviews.
After the main series concluded with the twelfth novel, Captain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stinks-A-Lot, in 2015 a spin-off series titled Dog Man, was released the following year. Currently the spin-off series has four books.
