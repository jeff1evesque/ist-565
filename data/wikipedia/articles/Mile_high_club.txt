The mile-high club is slang for the people who have had sexual intercourse on board an aircraft.An alleged explanation for the act is the supposed vibration of the plane, which may lead to sexual arousal among men.  Some say they have fantasies about pilots or flight attendants, or a fetish about planes themselves. For others, the appeal of joining the mile-high club is the thrill of doing something taboo and the thrill of the risk of being discovered.
