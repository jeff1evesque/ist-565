Bump fire is the act of using the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to fire shots in rapid succession, which simulates the rate of fire of a fully automatic firearm.
Bump fire gunstocks are of varying legality in the United States. The Department of Justice announced a plan on March 23, 2018 to classify bump stocks as "machine guns" and effectively ban them nationwide under existing federal law. If the rule becomes final, existing bump stocks would be required to be destroyed or surrendered by both manufacturers and individual owners.On April 17, 2018, Slide Fire Solutions, the sole holder of the bump stock patent, announced that it would cease production of bump stocks as of May 20, though they did not state whether this was a temporary or permanent measure. It has temporarily suspended production before.
