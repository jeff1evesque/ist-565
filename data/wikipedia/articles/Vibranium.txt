Vibranium () is a fictional metal appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. It is noted for its connection to Black Panther, as his suit is made from vibranium and is found in his native homeland of Wakanda. Antarctic Vibranium or Anti-Metal, is created by artificial means, in contrast to natural, or Wakandan, vibranium. Vibranium is also commonly known as one of the materials used to construct Captain America's shield.
