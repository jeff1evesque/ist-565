Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California. It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, Madden and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as Kara's Flowers in 1994, while they were still in high school. After self-releasing their independent album We Like Digging? in 1995, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the only debut album The Fourth World in 1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college.
In 2001, the band remerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine. The band signed with a subsidiary of J Records, Octone Records, and released their debut album Songs About Jane in June 2002. Aided by its lead single "Harder to Breathe", which received heavy airplay, the album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, and went platinum in 2004. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. 
The band's second album, It Won't Be Soon Before Long was released in 2007. It reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, "Makes Me Wonder", became the band's first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2010, the band released their third studio album Hands All Over, to mixed reviews, re-releasing a year later to include the single "Moves like Jagger", which topped the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, the band released their fourth album, Overexposed, which spawned four successful singles, with the second single, "One More Night", topping the Billboard Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks.
In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and Levine's own record label 222 Records, as the band released their fifth studio album V (pronounced "five"), which reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart, as well as the sixth studio album Red Pill Blues in 2017. Maroon 5 has sold more than 75 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists.
