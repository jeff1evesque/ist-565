Novak Djokovic was the defending champion, but lost to Dominic Thiem in the quarterfinals. This was the first time since 2010 that Djokovic did not reach at least the semifinals at Roland Garros, and it was also the first time since 2009 that Djokovic lost a match in straight sets at Roland Garros.
Rafael Nadal won his 10th French Open title and 15th Grand Slam singles title, defeating Stan Wawrinka in the final, 6–2, 6–3, 6–1.	
Nadal is the only male player to ever win 10 singles titles at the same Grand Slam event. Nadal won this event without losing a set for the third time, thereby tying with Björn Borg for this Grand Slam record.
