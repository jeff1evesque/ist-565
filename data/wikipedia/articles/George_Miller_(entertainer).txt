George Miller (born 18 September 1992), better known by his stage name Joji (stylised as joji), is a Japanese-Australian record producer, singer, songwriter, rapper and retired YouTube personality.
Miller's start as an entertainer began on his surreal YouTube channel, now defunct, that consisted of music, rants, ukulele performances and a bizarre show, with most of the main characters played by Miller including the titular character Filthy Frank. Miller also produced surreal comedy hip hop music under the name Pink Guy, with his discography spanning two full-length albums and an extended play. Miller's videos had widespread impact including starting a viral dance craze known as the Harlem Shake, which was directly responsible for the debut of Baauer's "Harlem Shake" song atop the Billboard Hot 100.In late 2017, Miller stepped away from the channel to focus on his music career, under the name Joji, producing more nuanced and serious music, releasing the EP In Tongues, which peaked at number 58 on the Billboard 200. Miller's music has been described as a mix between R&B and trip hop.
