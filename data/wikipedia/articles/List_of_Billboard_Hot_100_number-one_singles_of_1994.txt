This is a list of the American Billboard magazine Hot 100 number-ones of 1994. There were 10 singles that topped the chart this year. The first of these, "Hero" by Mariah Carey, spent one week at the top, concluding a four-week run that had begun in December 1993. The longest running number-one single of 1994 is "I'll Make Love to You" by Boyz II Men, which logged 14 weeks at number-one, tying the song with "I Will Always Love You" by Whitney Houston for the most weeks at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 until "One Sweet Day" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men stayed atop the chart from December 1995 to the first quarter of 1996.
With the rise of "On Bended Knee" to the top of the Hot 100, Boyz II Men became the first act to chart consecutive number-one singles in the United States since The Beatles charted three consecutive number-one singles in 1964.
