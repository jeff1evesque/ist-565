Once Upon a Time is an American fairy tale drama television series created by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, who also serve as executive producers alongside Steve Pearlman. It debuted on ABC on October 23, 2011. The first season introduces a bail bond agent, Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) and her birth-son, Henry Mills (Jared S. Gilmore), who discover that a New England town named Storybrooke, Maine is actually a remnant of a parallel world that was cursed by Henry's adoptive mother the Evil Queen/Mayor Regina Mills (Lana Parrilla) and that all the characters from the fairy tales have no memories of who they were, including the parents of Emma: Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Prince Charming/David Nolan (Josh Dallas), who sent her to the real world to save their world and break the curse.
In February 2018, it was announced the seventh season would serve as the final season of the series. During the course of the series, 155 episodes of Once Upon a Time aired over seven seasons.
