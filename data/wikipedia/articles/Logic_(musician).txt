Sir Robert Bryson Hall II (born January 22, 1990), known by his stage name Logic, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Raised in Gaithersburg, Maryland, Logic developed an interest in music as a teenager, and ventured into a musical career in early 2009 releasing Logic: The Mixtape and a mixtape titled Young, Broke & Infamous in 2010. He signed with Visionary Music Group, before releasing three more mixtapes over three years.
His fourth mixtape, Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever (2013), was released to critical acclaim, and allowed Logic to secure a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings. He later released his debut studio album Under Pressure in October 2014, which debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200, eventually becoming certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and having sold more than 171,000 copies. Logic's second studio album The Incredible True Story was released in November 2015, receiving mostly positive reviews from critics. Also certified gold in the U.S., it sold over 185,000 copies. Logic released his fifth mixtape, Bobby Tarantino, in 2016.
Logic's third studio album Everybody (2017) was his first to debut at number one in the U.S on the billboard 200. It sold 247,000 album-equivalent units, of which 196,000 were pure album sales. The album spawned his first international top 10 single as a lead artist, "1-800-273-8255", which reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100. In March 2018, Logic released his sixth mixtape, Bobby Tarantino II, a sequel to his 2016 mixtape. It also landed at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 119,000 equivalent album units in the first week.
