A fact is a statement that is consistent with objective reality or can be proven with evidence. The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability â€” that is, whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience. Standard reference works are often used to check facts. Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement (by experiments or other means).
