Survivor Series (2017) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event, produced by WWE for the Raw and SmackDown brands. It took place on November 19, 2017, at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. It was the thirty-first event under the Survivor Series chronology. The theme of the event was brand supremacy, and every match of the main card featured wrestlers of the Raw brand facing wrestlers of the SmackDown brand.
Ten matches were contested at the event, including three on the pre-show. The card was highlighted by two traditional Survivor Series elimination matches. In the main event, Team Raw's men defeated Team SmackDown's, and in the other elimination match, Team Raw's women also defeated Team SmackDown's. Also, every champion of the Raw brand faced their counterpart champion of the SmackDown brand in non-title matches, with the exception of Raw's WWE Cruiserweight Championship, which was the only title to be defended where Enzo Amore retained against Kalisto on the pre-show. Other prominent matches of the main card included Universal Champion Brock Lesnar defeating WWE Champion AJ Styles, which was the only one of four champion versus champion matches in which Raw defeated SmackDown, and Raw's The Shield defeated SmackDown's The New Day in their first pay-per-view match together since Payback in 2014. Raw won brand supremacy by winning four of the seven matches on the main card.
