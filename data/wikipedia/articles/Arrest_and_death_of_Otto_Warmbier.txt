Otto Frederick Warmbier (December 12, 1994 â€“ June 19, 2017) was an American college student from Cincinnati, Ohio, who was arrested in North Korea in January 2016 for attempted theft, for which he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. While incarcerated, he fell into a coma and never regained consciousness, dying in June 2017.
Warmbier was an Ohio native and the oldest of three siblings. He was traveling to Hong Kong for a study abroad program when he decided to visit North Korea on a guided tour. While there, he allegedly attempted to steal a propaganda poster, for which he was arrested and sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment with hard labor. Shortly after his sentencing, Warmbier suffered severe neurological injury from an unknown cause. North Korean authorities did not disclose his medical condition until June 2017, when they announced he had fallen into a coma as a result of botulism and a sleeping pill.
Warmbier was freed in June 2017, still in a comatose state after 17 months in captivity. He was repatriated to the United States, arriving in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 13. He was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center for immediate evaluation and treatment, where his U.S. physicians found no evidence of botulism. Nevertheless, a coroner's report was unable to identify the cause of the injury, finding no obvious evidence of torture on Warmbier's body. Nor did non-invasive internal scans find any signs of fractures to his skull. Warmbier never regained consciousness and died on June 19, 2017, six days after his return to the United States after his parents requested his feeding tube be removed. U.S. officials blamed North Korea for his death.
