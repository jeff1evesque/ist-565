Damir Džumhur (Bosnian pronunciation: [dǎːmir dʒûmxur], born 20 May 1992) is a Bosnian professional tennis player and currently Bosnia and Herzegovina's No. 1 player. He is a member of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Davis Cup team, and he competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics, being selected as the first male tennis player from his country to do so.
As a junior, he was ranked world no. 3 and he was a bronze medalist at the 2010 Youth Olympic Games. Džumhur is also the first male player to represent Bosnia and Herzegovina in the main draw of any Grand Slam tournament. His career-best ranking of 29 makes him the highest-ranked player ever competing for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
By winning 2017 St. Petersburg Open singles tournament, Džumhur became the first player competing under the Bosnian flag to claim an ATP World Tour title. He added triumph in 2017 Kremlin Cup onto that, as the first player in tennis history to win in the same season both events played on Russian soil.
