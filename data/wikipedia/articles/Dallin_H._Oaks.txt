Dallin Harris Oaks (born August 12, 1932) is an American jurist, educator, and religious leader who serves as the First Counselor in the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was called as a member of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1984. Currently, he is the second most senior apostle by years of service and is the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. However, consistent with long-established practice, due to Oaks serving in the First Presidency, M. Russell Ballard (third in seniority) currently serves as the quorum's acting president.
Oaks was born and raised in Provo, Utah. After graduating from high school in 1950, Oaks attended Brigham Young University (BYU) and graduated in 1954 with a B.S. in accounting.  He then studied at the University of Chicago Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the University of Chicago Law Review and graduated in 1957 with a J.D. cum laude.  After law school, Oaks spent one year as a law clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court.  In 1958, he returned to Chicago and worked for three years as an associate at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis before returning to the University of Chicago in 1961 as a professor of law.  He taught at Chicago until 1971, when he was chosen to succeed Ernest L. Wilkinson as the president of BYU.  Oaks was BYU's president from 1971 until 1980 and was then appointed to the Utah Supreme Court, on which he served until his selection to the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1984.  During this time, Oaks was twice considered by the U.S. president for nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court: first in 1975 by Gerald Ford, who ultimately nominated John Paul Stevens, and again in 1981 by Ronald Reagan, who ultimately nominated Sandra Day O'Connor.
