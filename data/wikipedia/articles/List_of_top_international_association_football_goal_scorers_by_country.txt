This page lists the top all-time male goal scorer for each national football team where the top scorer has a minimum 20 goals in official international matches for his country. Players who are currently active at international level are indicated in bold type.
This list is not an all-time top international goal scorers list, as some country's second-top scorer could have scored more than another country's top scorer. It lists only the top scorer for each country.
This list is for Men's association football only.
