"Arkangel" is the second episode of the fourth series of anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by Charlie Brooker and directed by Jodie Foster. The episode first aired on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017.
In the episode, "Arkangel" is the name of an implanted chip technology that allows a parent to track and monitor their children, as well as pixelate images that would cause them distress. Single mother Marie (played by Rosemarie DeWitt) has her young daughter Sara implanted with Arkangel, which while initially effective, becomes a dangerous hindrance, and Marie allows Sara to grow up without the use of Arkangel. As Sara matures into a  teenager (played by Brenna Harding), Marie becomes tempted to use Arkangel again.
The episode was the first of Black Mirror to be directed by a woman, and the first to have a strong emphasis on family. Arkangel was met with mixed reception and was compared to an indie-movie. Some critics praised the episode's concept, but thought the theme of helicopter parenting was emphasised at the expense of other, potentially more interesting aspects.
