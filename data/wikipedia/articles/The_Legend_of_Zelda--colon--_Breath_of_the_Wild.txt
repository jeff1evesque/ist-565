The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for Nintendo Switch and Wii U. An entry in the longrunning The Legend of Zelda series, Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline; the player controls Link, who awakens from a hundred-year slumber to defeat Calamity Ganon before it can destroy the kingdom of Hyrule.
Similarly to the original Legend of Zelda (1986), players are given little instruction and can explore the open world freely. Tasks include collecting multipurpose items to aid in objectives or solving puzzles and side quests for rewards. Breath of the Wild's world is unstructured and designed to reward experimentation, and the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion. Development of Breath of the Wild lasted five years. Wanting to reinvent the series, Nintendo introduced elements such as a detailed physics engine, high-definition visuals, and voice acting. Monolith Soft assisted in designing landscapes. The game was planned for release in 2015 as a Wii U exclusive, but was delayed twice due to problems with the physics engine. Released on March 3, 2017, Breath of the Wild was a launch game for Switch and the final Nintendo game for Wii U. Two downloadable content packs were released later in 2017.
Breath of the Wild received acclaim for its open-ended gameplay and attention to detail, with many publications describing it as one of the greatest video games of all time. Critics called it a landmark in open-world design, despite minor criticism for its technical performance at launch. It won numerous awards, including several game of the year awards. By June 2018, Breath of the Wild had sold over 10.8 million copies worldwide, making it the bestselling Zelda game.
