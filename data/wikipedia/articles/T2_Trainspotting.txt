T2 Trainspotting is a 2017 British crime comedy drama film, set in and around Edinburgh, Scotland. The film is directed by Danny Boyle and written by John Hodge, based on characters created by Irvine Welsh in his novel Trainspotting and its follow-up Porno. T2 was released in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2017 and worldwide throughout February and March 2017.
A sequel to Boyle's 1996 film Trainspotting, T2 stars the original ensemble cast, including leads Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle, with Shirley Henderson and James Cosmo, and Kelly Macdonald in a cameo. T2 features a new character, Veronika, played by Anjela Nedyalkova. T2 is deliberately self-referential, with film clips, music and echoes from the first film. The screenplay is based on Porno, with characters and elements lifted from the novel Trainspotting.
