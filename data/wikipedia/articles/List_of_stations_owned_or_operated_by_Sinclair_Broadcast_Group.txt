Sinclair Broadcast Group is the largest owner of television stations in the United States, currently owning or operating a total of 193 outlets across the country in nearly 80 markets, ranging from markets as large as Washington, D.C. to as small as Steubenville, Ohio. 
The stations are affiliates of various television networks, including ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox as well as numerous specialty channels.
Many stations are owned outright by the company, while others are owned by legally distinct companies but operated by Sinclair through a local marketing agreement, a concept Sinclair pioneered in Pittsburgh in 1991 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forbade duopolies. (The stations involved in the initial deal, WPGH-TV and WPTT — now WPNT — are now both owned by Sinclair outright.) Sinclair has established local marketing agreements with various companies, most notably Cunningham Broadcasting and Deerfield Media.
