David Ray Roberts (born May 31, 1972) is an American professional baseball manager and former outfielder. He is the current manager for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for five Major League teams over a ten-year career, and then coached for the San Diego Padres before being named Dodgers manager for the 2016 season. The son of an African-American father and Japanese mother, Roberts became the first manager of Asian descent to lead a team to the World Series in 2017, when the Dodgers captured the National League pennant. Although he played for the Boston Red Sox for only part of one season, his most notable achievement as a player was a key stolen base in the 2004 ALCS that ignited the Red Sox's drive to their curse-breaking championship that year. Roberts batted and threw left-handed.
