Halloween II is a 1981 American slasher film directed by Rick Rosenthal in his directorial debut, written and produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, and starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence who reprise their respective roles as Laurie Strode and Dr. Sam Loomis. It is the second installment in the Halloween film series and a direct sequel to Halloween. The plot picks up immediately after the events of the previous film, where Michael Myers follows survivor Laurie Strode to a nearby hospital, while Dr. Loomis is still in pursuit of his patient.
Stylistically, Halloween II reproduces certain key elements that made the original Halloween a success, such as first-person camera perspectives, and the film picks up right at the end of the cliffhanger ending of the original film. Upon its release on October 30, 1981, the sequel was a box office success by grossing over $25.5 million in the United States. However, the film received mixed reviews both during its initial run in theaters and since; several commentators criticized the film's generally uneven pace, plot holes and muted character performances, while praise was given to genuinely scary moments that captured the spirit of the first film.
Originally, Halloween II was intended to be the last chapter of the Halloween series to revolve around Michael Myers and the town of Haddonfield, but after the lackluster reaction to Season of the Witch (1982), the Michael Myers character was brought back six years later in The Return of Michael Myers (1988).
