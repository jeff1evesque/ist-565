The 2016 William Hill World Darts Championship was the 23rd World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation. The event started on 17 December 2015 and concluded on 3 January 2016. It was held at the Alexandra Palace, London, England.
Gary Anderson was the defending champion, having won his first world title in the 2015 final by beating 16-times champion Phil Taylor 7–6. He retained his title by beating Adrian Lewis 7–5. He also threw a nine-dart finish in his semi-final against Jelle Klaasen to add a bonus £15,000 to his winnings, and hit two maximum checkouts of 170 in the progress.	
Anderson became the fourth player to defend the world title following their first win, after Eric Bristow, Raymond van Barneveld and Lewis. He was also the sixth player to ever successfully defend a world championship, along with Phil Taylor and Martin Adams. There were 654 maximums thrown during the event, beating the record of 625 from the previous year. 34 of these were produced in the final which is a record for a professional match.Three-time world champion John Part was a notable absentee in this tournament, having failed to qualify for the first time since joining the PDC in 1997.
