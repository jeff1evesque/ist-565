The Quebec City mosque shooting (French: Attentat de la grande mosquée de Québec) was a mass shooting that occurred on the evening of January 29, 2017, at the Islamic Cultural Centre of Quebec City, a mosque in the Sainte-Foy neighbourhood of Quebec City, Canada. Six worshippers were killed and nineteen others injured when a lone gunman opened fire just before 8:00 pm, shortly after the end of evening prayers. Fifty-three people were reported present at the time of the shooting. 
The perpetrator, Alexandre Bissonnette, was charged with six counts of first-degree murder. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Philippe Couillard called the shooting a terrorist attack, but Bissonnette was not charged under the terrorism provision of the Criminal Code.
