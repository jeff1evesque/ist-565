Samuel Holmes "Sam" Sheppard ((1923-12-29)December 29, 1923 â€“ (1970-04-06)April 6, 1970) was an American neurosurgeon initially convicted for the 1954 murder of his wife, Marilyn Reese Sheppard. The case was controversial from the beginning, with extensive and prolonged nationwide media coverage.
The U.S. Supreme Court determined that the "carnival atmosphere" surrounding Sheppard's first trial had made due process impossible; after ten years in prison he was acquitted at a second trial.
