A motion of no confidence in the Spanish government of Mariano Rajoy was held between 31 May and 1 June 2018. The motion was registered by the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) on 25 May after the ruling People's Party (PP) was found to have profited from the illegal kickbacks-for-contracts scheme of the Gürtel case. The motion was successful and resulted in the downfall of Mariano Rajoy's government and in PSOE leader Pedro Sánchez becoming new Prime Minister of Spain. Rajoy announced on 5 June 2018 his resignation as PP leader after having led the party for 14 years.Previously to his ousting, Rajoy had hinted at the possibility he may not seek re-election for a third term in office. After resigning as PP leader, he confirmed his withdrawal from politics altogether, vacating his seat in the Congress of Deputies and returning to his position as property registrar in Santa Pola.
