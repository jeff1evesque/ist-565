Katherine Mary Knight (born 24 October 1955) is the first Australian woman to be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. She was convicted of the murder of her partner, John Charles Thomas Price, in October 2001, and is currently imprisoned at the Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre in New South Wales. Knight stabbed Price to death and then skinned him. She then put his skin on a meat hook, cooked his head and parts of his body, and placed them together with vegetables on plates with placecards with his children's names.
