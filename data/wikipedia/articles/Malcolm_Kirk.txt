Malcolm Kirk (18 December 1936 â€“ 24 August 1987) was an English professional wrestler who went by the ring name of "King Kong" Kirk as well as Kojak Kirk, Killer Kirk and "Mucky" Mal Kirk. He started as a rugby league player before becoming a professional wrestler. Kirk died of a heart attack on 24 August 1987 after collapsing in the ring during a tag team match at the Hippodrome in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, England. The wrestling event was run by Joint Promotions with the main event being a tag team match between Kirk and King Kendo (Bill Clarke) against Big Daddy (Shirley Crabtree) and Greg Valentine (Steve Crabtree) in front of 1,500 people. Kirk's death and the aftermath led to the decline of professional wrestling in the United Kingdom.
