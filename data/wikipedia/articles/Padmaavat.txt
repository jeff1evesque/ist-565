Padmaavat is a 2018 Indian epic period drama film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Loosely based on the epic poem Padmavat by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, it stars Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati, a Rajput queen known for her beauty, wife of Maharawal Ratan Singh,
played by Shahid Kapoor. Sultan Alauddin Khilji, played by Ranveer Singh, hears of her beauty and attacks her kingdom to claim her. Aditi Rao Hydari, Jim Sarbh, Raza Murad, and Anupriya Goenka featured in supporting roles.With a production budget of ₹2.15 billion (US$31 million), Padmaavat is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made. Initially scheduled for release on 1 December 2017, Padmaavat faced numerous controversies. Amid violent protests, its release was indefinitely delayed. In December, the Central Board of Film Certification approved the film with few changes, which includes the addition of multiple disclaimers and a change in title. Padmaavat was rescheduled for release on 25 January 2018 in 2D, 3D and IMAX 3D formats, making it the first Indian film to be released in IMAX 3D.Padmaavat received mixed reviews. Critics praised the visuals, the cinematography and Singh's portrayal of Khilji, but criticised its storyline, execution, length and adherence to regressive patriarchal mores. Critics also disliked the portrayal of Khilji as a stereotypical evil Muslim king and Ratan Singh as the righteous Hindu king. Despite not being released in some states of India, it grossed over ₹5.85 billion (US$85 million) at the box office, becoming a commercial success and one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time.
