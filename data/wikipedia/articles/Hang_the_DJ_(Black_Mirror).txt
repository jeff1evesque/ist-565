"Hang the DJ" is the fourth episode of the fourth series of anthology series Black Mirror. It was written by Charlie Brooker and directed by Tim Van Patten. The episode first aired on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017.
Amy (Georgina Campbell) and Frank (Joe Cole) are two of many people in a walled-off System who are placed by a digital companion, Coach (voiced by Gina Bramhill), into trial romantic relationships with others. Coach dictates how long partners can spend together, collects their data, and helps them find their "ultimate compatible other". Amy and Frank meet for just 12 hours before being paired off with others. After a few brief encounters, they realise they are in love, and try to rebel against Coach and the System.
The episode received critical acclaim for its simple, satisfying storyline and Campbell and Cole's performances. Critics praised the Tinder and Siri-like technologies explored throughout the episode and its ending. Some compared the episode to the uplifting tone of "San Junipero".
