Bill de Blasio (; born Warren Wilhelm Jr.; May 8, 1961) is an American politician who is currently serving as the 109th Mayor of New York City. Previous to his assumption of the mayoralty, he served as New York City's public advocate from 2010 to 2013.
Born in Manhattan, he graduated from New York University and Columbia University before a brief stint as a campaign manager for Charles Rangel and Hillary Clinton. He started his career as an elected official by serving on the New York City Council representing the 39th district in Brooklyn from 2002 to 2009. His tenure as public advocate saw a reformation of various educational, housing, and campaign finance policies. He was elected Mayor of New York City in the landslide 2013 election and retained his office in 2017, another landslide election.
During his first term, he restructured the controversial stop and frisk program and took steps to improve relations between the New York City Police Department and minorities. He initiated new de-escalation training for officers, reduced prosecutions for cannabis possession, implemented the usage of police body cameras, and ended the post-9/11 surveillance program of Muslim residents. He passed free universal Pre-K in the city, although his effort to start a millionaire tax was rejected by New York governor Andrew Cuomo. De Blasio attempted to install an unprecedented rent-freeze citywide for rent-stabilized apartments in 2015.
A self-identified populist, de Blasio has expressed concern with the stark level of economic inequality in New York City, which he has called the "tale of two cities". He has publicly supported a socially liberal, progressive, and neoliberal discourse on the city's economy, urban planning, public education, police relations, and privatization. De Blasio has maintained high approval rates and levels of public support throughout his tenure, albeit slightly lower than his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg.
