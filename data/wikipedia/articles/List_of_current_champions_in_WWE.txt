WWE is a professional wrestling promotion based out of Stamford, Connecticut. Title reigns are either determined by professional wrestling matches or are awarded to a wrestler, as a result of the culmination of various scripted storylines. The WWE splits its main roster into two distinctive brands, Raw and SmackDown, as well as a developmental brand, NXT, with each having their own set of championships. There are five active singles championships for male wrestlers, two active championships for female wrestlers, and two active tag team championships between Raw and SmackDown, and two male, one female, and one tag team championship on NXT. There is also one championship representing the United Kingdom, which is the centerpiece of NXT UK, with championships for the UK's women and tag team divisions set to be established in the future.
