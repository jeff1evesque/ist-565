The 2018 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup was an international limited-overs cricket tournament that was held in New Zealand from 13 January to 3 February 2018. It was the twelfth edition of the Under-19 Cricket World Cup, and the third to be held in New Zealand (after the 2002 and 2010 events). New Zealand was the first country to host the event three times. The opening ceremony took place on 7 January 2018. The West Indies were the defending champions. However, they failed to defend their title, after losing their first two group fixtures.Following the group stage fixtures, Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa had all qualified for the Super League quarter-final stage of the tournament. The other eight teams moved to the Plate League to determine their final placements in the competition. Sri Lanka went on to win the Plate League, giving them a final position of ninth overall in the tournament.In the first Super League semi-final, Australia beat Afghanistan by 6 wickets to progress to the final. In the second semi-final, India beat Pakistan by 203 runs to advance into the final. In the third-place playoff, no play was possible due to rain and a wet outfield. Pakistan therefore finished in third place, as they finished their group ahead of Afghanistan on net run rate. In the final, India beat Australia by 8 wickets to win their fourth Under-19 World Cup, the most by any side.
