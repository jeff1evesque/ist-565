Mandalay is a poem by Rudyard Kipling, first published in the collection Barrack-Room Ballads, and Other Verses in 1892. The poem is set in colonial Burma, then part of British India. The protagonist is a Cockney working-class soldier, back in grey restrictive London, recalling the time he felt free and had a Burmese girlfriend, now unattainably far away.
The poem became his best-known, especially after it was set to music by Oley Speaks in 1907, and was admired by Kipling's contemporaries, who objected however to its muddled geography. It has been criticised as a "vehicle for imperial thought", but more recently has been defended by Kipling's biographer David Gilmour and others. Other critics have identified a variety of themes in the poem, including exotic erotica, Victorian prudishness, romanticism, class, power, and gender.
The song, with Speaks's music, was sung by Frank Sinatra with alterations to the text such as "broad" for "girl" which were disliked by Kipling's family. Bertolt Brecht's Mandalay Song, set to music by Kurt Weill, alludes to the poem.
