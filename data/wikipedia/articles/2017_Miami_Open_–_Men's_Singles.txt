Novak Djokovic was the defending champion, but withdrew before the tournament began due to a right elbow injury. Reigning world No. 1 Andy Murray also withdrew before the start of the tournament due to a right elbow injury. This marked the first time since 1990, when the Masters Series/1000 tournaments were created, that neither the world No. 1 nor No. 2 played the Miami Open, and the first time since the 2005 Madrid Masters that neither Djokovic nor Murray featured in the main draw of a Masters Series/1000 event.Stan Wawrinka earned the No. 1 seed at an ATP Masters 1000 event for the first time. He became the first player other than the Big Four to be the top seed at an ATP Masters 1000 event since Andy Roddick at the 2005 BNP Paribas Masters.Roger Federer won his third title in Miami, defeating Rafael Nadal in the final, 6–3, 6–4. It was Federer's 26th Masters 1000 singles title and 91st singles title overall. It was Nadal's 5th runner-up finish without winning the title. This marks the third time Federer has won in Indian Wells and Miami back-to-back (previously accomplishing the feat in 2005 and 2006). It is also the fourth consecutive year in which the same player won both the Indian Wells and Miami tournaments (Djokovic won back-to-back titles between 2014 and 2016).
