NXT TakeOver is the name given to the periodic specials produced by WWE featuring its NXT brand, which are streamed live on the WWE Network. NXT TakeOver events are held several times a year, and are considered the brand's equivalent of main roster pay-per-view shows.The first NXT live special was uniquely titled NXT Arrival in 2014. However, after the debut NXT TakeOver show aired a few months later, the "TakeOver" name has been used for subsequent NXT live specials. All NXT live specials were initially held at Full Sail University, prior to the brand extending to arena shows after premiering NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn in 2015. The shows have since been held at various national and international locations.  
Since 2016, NXT TakeOver events typically air a day prior to the "big four" WWE pay-per-view events (WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, SummerSlam and Survivor Series), but not always. Under this new format, TakeOvers are held in the same city as the "big four" pay-per-view events, and also share the same arena. However, this format is not enforced, with several shows airing prior to different pay-per-view events, or acting as standalone shows.
