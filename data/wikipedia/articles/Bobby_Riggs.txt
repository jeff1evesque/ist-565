Robert Larimore Riggs (February 25, 1918 â€“ October 25, 1995) was an American tennis champion who was the World No. 1 or the World co-No. 1 player for three years, first as an amateur in 1939, then as a professional in 1946 and 1947. He played his first professional tennis match on December 26, 1941.
As a 21-year-old amateur in 1939, Riggs won Wimbledon, the U.S. National Championships (now U.S. Open), and was runner-up at the French Championships. He was U.S. champion again in 1941, after a runner-up finish the year before.
After retirement from pro career, Riggs became famous as a hustler and gambler. He organized exhibition challenges, inviting active and retired tennis pros to participate. At age 55 he held one such event against women's champion Billie Jean King, which he lost. Their prime time "Battle of the Sexes" match in 1973 remains one of the most famous tennis events of all time, with a $100,000 ($551,000 today) winner-take-all prize.
