The Billboard Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by Billboard magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical sales and airplay. There were nine singles that peaked atop the charts, but if "Un-Break My Heart" is excluded from the count (for the song started its peak in the previous year), the total would be eight, the second lowest for a single year, tied with 1996 and subsequently, 2005. The longest running number-one single of 1997 is "Candle in the Wind 1997"/"Something About the Way You Look Tonight", which logged 14 weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100. Two of those weeks were logged in 1998 while the remaining 12 were attained in 1997.
With "Honey" becoming her 12th #1 single, Mariah Carey broke the record for most #1 songs by a female artist, surpassing Madonna and Whitney Houston with 11 each.
