Sean Michael Spicer  (born September 23, 1971) is an American political aide who served as the twenty-eighth White House Press Secretary and as White House Communications Director under President Donald Trump in 2017. Spicer was communications director of the Republican National Committee from 2011 to 2017, and its chief strategist from 2015 to 2017.During his tenure as White House press secretary, Spicer made a number of public statements that were controversial and false, and he developed a contentious relationship with the White House press corps. The first such instance occurred on January 21, 2017, the day following Trump's inauguration. Spicer repeated the claim that crowds at Trump's inauguration ceremony were the largest ever at such an event and that the press had deliberately under-estimated the number of spectators. After this statement was widely criticized, Trump aide Kellyanne Conway said that Spicer had presented what she called "alternative facts" regarding the inauguration's attendance numbers.On July 21, 2017, Spicer announced his resignation as White House Press Secretary, although he remained at the White House in an unspecified capacity until August 31, 2017.
