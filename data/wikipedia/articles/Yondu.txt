Yondu Udonta, or simply Yondu (), is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The original version of the character is depicted as the last survivor of his species in the 31st century, and is a founding member of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team from the Marvel Multiverse alternate reality known as Earth-691.
Yondu in Earth-691 is depicted as a blue-skinned male with a large red fin protruding from the back of his head and back; he is a spiritual warrior who can control his killing arrows via sound waves, most commonly by whistling. Yondu joined Vance Astro and other survivors of the Badoon attack on Earth's solar system in the 31st Century, who became known as the Guardians of the Galaxy. As part of the Guardians, Yondu traveled to present-day Earth and became an honorary member of the Avengers. The original Yondu never starred as a solo character in any Marvel Comic books, but was a core member of the team in the Guardians of the Galaxy comic that ran from 1990 to 1995.
A second version of Yondu was first introduced into the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the 2014 Marvel Studios film Guardians of the Galaxy, portrayed by Michael Rooker, where he is a space pirate leading one of the factions of "The Ravagers". He also appears in the film's 2017 sequel, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. After the release of the first film, Marvel Comics introduced a comic book version of the character to the Earth-616 comic book continuity.
The present day Yondu character has appeared both in the Guardians of the Galaxy animated show as well as being a playable character in video games.
