The Liberator is a physible, 3D-printable single shot  handgun, the first such printable firearm design made widely available online. The open source firm Defense Distributed designed the gun and released the plans on the Internet on May 6, 2013. The plans were downloaded over 100,000 times in the two days before the United States Department of State demanded that Defense Distributed retract the plans.The plans for the gun remain hosted across the Internet and are available at file sharing websites like The Pirate Bay and GitHub.
On July 19th, 2018 the United States Department of Justice reached a settlement with Defense Distributed, allowing the sale of plans for 3D-printed firearms online, beginning August 1, 2018. President of the United States Donald Trump tweeted a cryptic message in apparent reference to the decision to allow the online publication of the Liberator's files: “I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!”.

A federal judge on July 31, 2018 stopped the release of blueprints to make the liberator due to it being an untraceable and undetectable 3D-printed plastic gun, citing safety concerns.
