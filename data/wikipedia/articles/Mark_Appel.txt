Mark Stewart Appel (born July 15, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Philadelphia Phillies organization.
After being drafted out of high school by the Detroit Tigers in 2009, Appel elected to attend Stanford University and play for the Stanford Cardinal baseball team. Named the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association's Pitcher of the Year in 2012, he was projected as the first overall draft choice in the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, but fell in the draft due to signability concerns. Appel did not sign after being selected eighth overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates, returning to Stanford for his senior season. 
The Houston Astros selected him with the first overall pick in the 2013 Major League Baseball Draft, and he signed with them. Appel was traded to the Phillies after the 2015 season. After continued struggles, he was designated for assignment by the Phillies on November 20, 2017. In February 2018, at the age of 26, Appel announced that he would step away from baseball. If Appel never returns to the game, he will be the third number-one MLB draft pick never to play in the major leagues, after Steve Chilcott and Brien Taylor.
