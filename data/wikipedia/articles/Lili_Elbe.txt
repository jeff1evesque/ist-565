Lili Ilse Elvenes (28 December 1882 â€“ 13 September 1931), better known as Lili Elbe, was a Danish transgender woman and one of the first identifiable recipients of sex reassignment surgery. Elbe was born Einar Magnus Andreas Wegener and was a successful painter under that name. During this time she also presented as Lili (sometimes spelled Lily) and was publicly introduced as Einar's sister. After successfully transitioning in 1930, she changed her legal name to Lili Ilse Elvenes and stopped painting altogether. The name Lili Elbe was given to her by Copenhagen journalist Louise Lassen. She died from complications involving a uterus transplant. Her autobiography, Man into Woman, was posthumously published in 1933.
