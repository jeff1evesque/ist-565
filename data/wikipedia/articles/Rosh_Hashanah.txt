Rosh Hashanah (Hebrew: רֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה‬), literally meaning the "beginning (also head) [of] the year" is the Jewish New Year. The biblical name for this holiday is Yom Teruah (יוֹם תְּרוּעָה‬), literally "day [of] shouting or blasting". It is the first of the Jewish High Holy Days (יָמִים נוֹרָאִים‬ Yamim Nora'im. "Days [of] Awe") specified by Leviticus 23:23–32 which occur in the early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere.
Rosh Hashanah is a two-day celebration which begins on the first day of Tishrei, which is the first month of the Jewish civil year but the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year. It marks the beginning of the year, according to the teachings of Judaism, because it is the traditional anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve, the first man and woman according to the Hebrew Bible, and the inauguration of humanity's role in God's world. According to one secular opinion, the holiday owes its timing to the beginning of the economic year in Southwest Asia and Northeast Africa, marking the start of the agricultural cycle.Rosh Hashanah customs include sounding the shofar (a hollowed-out ram's horn), as prescribed in the Torah, following the prescription of the Hebrew Bible to "raise a noise" on Yom Teruah. Its rabbinical customs include attending synagogue services and reciting special liturgy about teshuva, as well as enjoying festive meals. Eating symbolic foods is now a tradition, such as apples dipped in honey, hoping to evoke a sweet new year.
