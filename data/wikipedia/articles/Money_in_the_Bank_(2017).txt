Money in the Bank (2017) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event produced by WWE for the SmackDown brand. It took place on June 18, 2017, at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the eighth event under the Money in the Bank chronology and the first to feature a Women's Money in the Bank ladder match.
Seven matches were contested at the event, including one on the pre-show and two Money in the Bank ladder matches on the main card. In the main event, Baron Corbin won the men's ladder match, earning a contract for a WWE Championship match, while Carmella controversially won the first women's ladder match to earn a SmackDown Women's Championship match contract. In another prominent match, Jinder Mahal defeated Randy Orton to retain the WWE Championship. The event was also notable for the return of Maria Kanellis, who had last performed in WWE in 2010, and the WWE debut of her husband Mike Kanellis.
