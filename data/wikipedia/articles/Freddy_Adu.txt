Fredua Koranteng "Freddy" Adu (born June 2, 1989) is an American soccer player who plays for Las Vegas Lights FC in the United Soccer League. He plays primarily as an attacking midfielder, but he is also used as a winger or forward. From before the time of his signing with D.C. United at the age of 14, Adu was spoken of and treated as the future of United States soccer; even being referred to as "the next Pelé". However, he failed to live up to the expectations and after leaving D.C. United in 2006, has turned into a journeyman, playing for thirteen teams in eight different countries: the United States, Portugal, Monaco, Greece, Turkey, Brazil, Serbia, and Finland.
At D.C. United, Adu broke several records. First, he became the youngest athlete ever to sign a professional contract in the United States, after he was selected by the team in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft on January 16, 2004. Three months later, on April 3, 2004, he became the youngest player to appear in a Major League Soccer (MLS) game when he came on as a substitute in a game against the San Jose Earthquakes, and on April 17, he became the youngest scorer in MLS history, scoring a goal in a 3–2 loss to the MetroStars.
