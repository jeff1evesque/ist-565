Yuzuru Hanyu (羽生結弦, Hanyū Yuzuru, born December 7, 1994) is a Japanese figure skater who competes in the men's singles discipline. He is a two-time Olympic champion (2014, 2018), a two-time World champion (2014, 2017), a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (2013–2016), a three-time Four Continents silver medalist (2011, 2013, 2017), the 2010 World Junior champion, the 2009–10 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, and a four-time Japanese national champion (2012–2015). He has also medaled at three other World Championships, taking bronze in 2012, and silver in 2015 and 2016.
Regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest figure skater in history, Hanyu has broken world records twelve times, and holds the historic world records for the highest short program, free skating, and combined total scores for the era before the 2018-19 season. He is the first man to have broken the 100-point barrier in the men's short program, the 200-point barrier in the men's free skating, and the 300-point barrier in the combined total score.
Hanyu is the first Asian figure skater competing in men's singles to win the Olympic gold. At the age of nineteen, he was the youngest male skater to win the Olympic title since Dick Button in 1948. He also became the first man to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals since Dick Button's back-to-back titles in 1948 and 1952. At the 2016 CS Autumn Classic International, Hanyu became the first skater in history to successfully land a quadruple loop in competition. He is the first men's singles skater from Asia to win multiple World Championships.
In recognition of his achievements, Hanyu has been awarded with numerous accolades, most importantly the People's Honour Award (in 2018) and the Medal of Honour with Purple Ribbon (in 2014 and 2018).
