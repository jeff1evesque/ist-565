WWE Backlash is a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event, that is produced by WWE, a professional wrestling promotion based in Connecticut. The event was created in 1999, with its inaugural event produced as an In Your House event in April of that year. The event in 2000 was rebranded as an annual PPV event for WWE. To coincide with the brand extension, the event was made exclusive to the Raw brand in 2004. In 2007, to follow the format of WrestleMania, all PPV events became tri-branded. Extreme Rules replaced Backlash in 2010.After the newly reinstated WWE Brand Extension took effect in 2016, Backlash returned as a SmackDown exclusive event as a post-SummerSlam event on the same year, while the 2017 edition of the event still remained SmackDown-exclusive event and returned to being a post-WrestleMania pay-per-view event, paralleling Raw's Payback. In 2018, it was announced that Backlash would be a dual brand event.
