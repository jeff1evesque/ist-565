Dhadak (transl. Heartbeat; Hindi pronunciation: [d̪əʱɽək]) is a 2018 Indian Hindi-language tragic romance film written and directed by Shashank Khaitan. It was jointly produced by Karan Johar, Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta under the Dharma Productions banner with Zee Studios. A remake of the Marathi language film Sairat (2016), the film stars Ishaan Khatter and debutant Janhvi Kapoor, with Ashutosh Rana, Ankit Bisht, Shridhar Watsar, Kshitij Kumar and Aishwarya Narkar in supporting roles.
Johar announced the production of Dhadak in November 2017; it marked the screen debut of Janhvi Kapoor, daughter of Sridevi and Boney Kapoor. Principal photography commenced in December 2017 and was completed in April 2018. The soundtrack was composed by Ajay-Atul with lyrics written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and background score composed by John Stewart Eduri. The film was distributed internationally by Zee Studios.
Dhadak, which was originally scheduled to release on 6 July 2018, was postponed and had its worldwide theatrical release on 20 July 2018. It received negative reviews from film critics for glossing over the subject of caste-based discrimination, which was present in Sairat, and for being a poor remake of the original, although Khatter's performance was praised. Dhadak emerged as a commercial success, grossing over ₹109 crore (US$16 million), becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of 2018.
