Hans Walter Conrad Veidt (22 January 1893 â€“ 3 April 1943) was a German actor best remembered for his roles in films such as Different from the Others (1919), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), and The Man Who Laughs (1928). After a successful career in German silent films, where he was one of the best-paid stars of Ufa, he was forced to leave Germany in 1933 after the Nazis came to power, along with his new Jewish wife. They settled in Britain, where he participated in a number of films, including The Thief of Bagdad (1940), before emigrating to the United States around 1941, which led to him having a supporting role in Casablanca (1942).
