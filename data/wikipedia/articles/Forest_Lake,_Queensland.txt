Forest Lake was the first Master Planned Community within the municipality of Brisbane, Queensland.  It has won numerous awards for its design and had a population of 20,900 residents, as of February 2006. Delfin, the developer of Forest Lake, was absorbed into Lend Lease in 2001. Now operating as Delfin Lend Lease, they are developing the adjacent Springfield Lakes Master Planned Community.
Forest Lake was considered instrumental in the creation of affordable housing within Australia. The development was the first modern day community to contain small lot product, a first during its time. The master planned community contained retail, commercial, educational, residential, retirement, and recreational uses. The entire community is linked by an extensive network of pedestrian and cycle paths, which are integrated into the large open space network.
Forest Lake lies within the Brisbane City Council municipality and is approximately 19 kilometres (12 mi) from the Brisbane central business district. It adjoins the suburbs of Doolandella, Inala, Richlands and Heathwood. It successfully mixes wildlife with residential development.
The Forest Lake Shopping Centre (formerly Forest Lake Village Shopping Centre) is located in Forest Lake.
