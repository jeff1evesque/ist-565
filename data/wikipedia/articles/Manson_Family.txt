The Manson Family was a desert commune and cult formed in California in the late 1960s. Led by Charles Manson, the group consisted of approximately 100 of his followers who lived an unconventional lifestyle with habitual use of hallucinogenic drugs. Most of the group members were young women from middle-class backgrounds, many of whom were radicalised by Manson's teachings and drawn by hippy culture and communal living.After Manson was released from prison for petty crimes in 1967, the Manson Family moved to San Francisco and later to a deserted ranch in the San Fernando Valley. Mansonâ€™s followers also included a small, devoted unit of mostly impressionable young women and girls. They began to believe, without question, Manson's claims that he was a manifestation of Jesus and his prophecies of a race war.
They gained national and international notoriety after the murder of actress Sharon Tate and four others on August 9, 1969 by Tex Watson and three other members of the Family, acting under the instructions of Charles Manson. Group members were also responsible for a number of other murders, assaults, petty crimes and thefts.
