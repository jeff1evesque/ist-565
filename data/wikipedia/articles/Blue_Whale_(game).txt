Blue Whale (Russian: Синий кит, translit. Siniy kit), also known as Blue Whale Challenge, is a social network phenomenon dating from 2016 that is claimed to exist in several countries. It is a "game" reportedly consisting of a series of tasks assigned to players by administrators over a 50-day period, initially innocuous before introducing elements of self-harm and the final challenge requiring the player to commit suicide despite no cases having been confirmed. 
"Blue Whale" first attracted news coverage in May 2016 in an article in a Russian newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, that linked many unrelated child suicides to membership of group "F57" on the Russian-based VKontakte social network. A wave of moral panic swept Russia. However, the piece was later criticised for attempting to make a causal link where none existed, and none of the suicides was found to be as a result of the group activities.
