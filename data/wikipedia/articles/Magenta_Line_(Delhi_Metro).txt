The Magenta Line (मेजेन्टा लाइन) is a line of Delhi Metro, a rapid transit system in Delhi, India and the first driverless metro in India. It consists of 25 metro stations from Janakpuri West to Botanical Garden, out of which 10 are elevated and rest 15 are underground. The total length of the line is 36.98 km out of which 10.466 km is elevated and 23.807 km is underground. Unlike the Airport Metro Express the line will directly serve Terminal 1 of the Indira Gandhi International Airport. 
The line has been operational between Botanical Garden to Kalkaji Mandir since 25 December 2017 and rest of the section between Janakpuri West and Kalkaji Mandir was made operational on 29 May 2018. The Hauz Khas station on this line and the current Yellow Line is the deepest Metro station at a depth of 32 metres, surpassing the record set by Chawri Bazaar station on the Yellow Line, at a depth of 22 metres. Janakpuri West metro station on the line contains India's tallest escalator with vertical height of 15.6 metres. The Magenta line interchanges with the Yellow, Blue, and the Violet lines of the Delhi Metro network.
Shankar Vihar metro station on the line is unique as it is the only station on the network where free movement of civilians is restricted by the military, as it falls in the Delhi Cantonment area and according to DMRC official "located right in the heart of the defence zone, it thus will cater primarily to defence personnel"..
For the first time in India, the construction work of two parallel tunnels was completed together at Dabri Mor station. The Janakpuri West, Dabri Mor & Dashrath Puri stations on Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden line have been executed by an HCC-Samsung joint venture.
