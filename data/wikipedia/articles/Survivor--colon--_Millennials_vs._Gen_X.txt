Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X is the 33rd season of the American CBS competitive reality television series Survivor. It featured two initial tribes of ten new castaways divided by generation: Gen X, born between 1963 and 1982, and Millennials, born between 1984 and 1997 (no one born in 1983 was cast this season). It is the third season to divide the castaways into tribes by age, following Survivor: Panama and  Survivor: Nicaragua, and the second season to film in Fiji, following Survivor: Fiji, which was filmed in a different location. The season premiered on September 21, 2016 with a 90-minute episode and ended on December 14, 2016 when Adam Klein was unanimously awarded the title of Sole Survivor over Ken McNickle and Hannah Shapiro by a jury vote of 10–0–0.
This season featured the first full cast evacuation, where all contestants were removed on the second day of competition due to Cyclone Zena; the castaways were returned to their camps the next morning and no additional time was needed to complete the game.
