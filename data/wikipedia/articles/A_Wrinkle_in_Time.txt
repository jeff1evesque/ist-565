A Wrinkle in Time is a science fantasy novel written by American writer Madeleine L'Engle, first published in 1962. The book won the Newbery Medal, Sequoyah Book Award, and Lewis Carroll Shelf Award, and was runner-up for the Hans Christian Andersen Award. It is the first book in L'Engle's Time Quintet, which follows the Murrys and Calvin O'Keefe.
The book inspired two film adaptations, both by Disney: a 2003 television film directed by John Kent Harrison, and a 2018 theatrical film directed by Ava DuVernay.
