Deontay Leshun Wilder (born October 22, 1985) is an American professional boxer. He has held the WBC heavyweight title since 2015, and in doing so became the first American world heavyweight champion in nine years, which was the longest period of time in boxing history without an American heavyweight champion. As an amateur he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division at the 2008 Olympics. This led to his nickname of "The Bronze Bomber", which Wilder coined after Joe Louis, who was known by the nickname of "The Brown Bomber".
Wilder is particularly known for having finished all but one of his fights inside the distance. His knockout-to-win ratio stands at 98%, with 19 knockouts in the first round, as well as having stopped every opponent he has faced. He is a two-time winner of the Premier Boxing Champions Knockout of the Year award, in 2016 and 2017.
As of March 2018, Wilder is ranked as the world's second best active heavyweight by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, The Ring magazine, and BoxRec. He is the 15th longest reigning world heavyweight champion of all time, and has the 9th longest combined and individual title streaks in modern heavyweight boxing history at seven and six title bouts, respectively.
