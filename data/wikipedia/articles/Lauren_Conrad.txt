Lauren Katherine Tell (n√©e Conrad; born February 1, 1986) is an American television personality, fashion designer, and author. Born and raised in Laguna Beach, California, she attended Laguna Beach High School. In September 2004, at the age of 18, Conrad came to prominence after being cast in the reality television series Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County, which documented her life and friends' lives.
After moving to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the fashion industry in May 2006, Conrad was commissioned to star in her own spin-off series The Hills, which chronicled the personal and professional lives of her and friends Heidi Montag, Audrina Patridge, and Whitney Port. During its production, she attended the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising and held positions with Teen Vogue and Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. As the series progressed, a widely publicized feud developed between Conrad, Montag and Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt. Consequently, the conflict became the central focus of the series, and was carried through each subsequent season in which Conrad appeared.
In May 2009, Conrad left The Hills after five seasons, and was replaced by former Laguna Beach cast member Kristin Cavallari. She filmed an alternate ending for the series finale in July 2010, which was broadcast in August 2013. Conrad launched the fashion lines LC Lauren Conrad and Paper Crown in 2009 and 2011, respectively. She released the L.A. Candy book trilogy in 2010 and the spin-off The Fame Game series in 2012. Conrad married former musician and law school graduate William Tell in September 2014.
