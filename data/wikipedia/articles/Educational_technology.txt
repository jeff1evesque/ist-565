Educational technology is "the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using, and managing appropriate technological processes and resources".Educational technology is the use of both physical hardware and educational theoretics. It encompasses several domains including learning theory, computer-based training, online learning, and where mobile technologies are used, m-learning. Accordingly, there are several discrete aspects to describing the intellectual and technical development of educational technology:

Educational technology as the theory and practice of educational approaches to learning.
Educational technology as technological tools and media that assist in the communication of knowledge, and its development and exchange. This is usually what people are referring to when they use the term 'EdTech'.
Educational technology for learning management systems (LMS), such as tools for student and curriculum management, and education management information systems (EMIS).
Educational technology as back-office management, such as training management systems for logistics and budget management, and Learning Record Store (LRS) for learning data storage and analysis.
Educational technology itself as an educational subject; such courses may be called "Computer Studies" or "Information and communications technology (ICT)".An educational technologist is someone who is trained in the field of educational technology. Educational technologists try to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate process and tools to enhance learning. While the term educational technologist is used primarily in the United States, learning technologist is synonymous and used in the UK as well as Canada.
