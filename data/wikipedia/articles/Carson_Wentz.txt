Carson James Wentz (born December 30, 1992) is an American football quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at North Dakota State University (NDSU) and was selected by the Eagles with the second overall pick of the 2016 NFL Draft, the highest selection ever for an FCS player.
During his time at NDSU, the team won five NCAA FCS national championships. In his first year with the Eagles, Wentz accumulated multiple NFL and Eagles rookie records, which included the most pass attempts by a rookie quarterback and most pass completions by a rookie. In the 2017 season, Wentz was crucial to the strong and powerful start which had the Eagles at an 11-2 record at the time he went down. He was 2nd in the NFL in touchdown passes with 33, as well as a media and fan favorite to win MVP but missed the last three games of the season due to a season-ending ACL injury in his left knee. Led by Nick Foles, the Eagles would go on to win Super Bowl LII over the New England Patriots, the first in franchise history, earning Wentz a championship ring.
