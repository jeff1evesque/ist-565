After leaving Liverpool in June 2010, Benítez was appointed manager of treble winning side Inter Milan. His reign at the club was a short one and he was let go midway through the 2010–11 season despite guiding the team to the Supercoppa Italiana and FIFA Club World Cup titles. In November 2012, he was appointed interim manager of Chelsea for the remainder of the season and he won the 2013 Europa League.
Benítez returned to Italy in 2013 to coach Napoli, where he won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana. Benítez then left Napoli and became coach of Real Madrid in June 2015 on an initial three-year contract.
