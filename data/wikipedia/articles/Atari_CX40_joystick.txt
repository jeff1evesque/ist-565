The Atari CX40 joystick was the first widely used cross-platform game controller. The original CX10 appeared on the Atari 2600 in 1977, and was considered such a great advance over other controllers that it became the primary input device for most games on the platform. The CX10 was replaced after a year by the much simpler and less expensive CX40. The addition of the Atari joystick port to other platforms cemented its popularity, and millions of CX40s were produced and used on almost every game console and home computer of the era.
The CX40 was so popular during its run that it became as iconic to Atari as the company's "Fuji" logo; it remains a common staple in video game iconography to this day, and is commonly referred to as the symbol of 1980s video game system design. The CX40 has been called "the pinnacle of home entertainment controllers in its day", and remains a staple  of industrial design discussions.The CX40 also had several well-known problems and was subject to eventual mechanical breakdown. A number of more robust third-party alternatives were available in a thriving market, but generally at much higher prices so they never achieved widespread popularity in comparison to the CX40.
The introduction of the computer mouse on the Macintosh, and then on most second-generation home computers, led to the demise of the Atari-style joystick. Today analog joysticks are used largely in special-purpose roles like flight simulators and similar programs. Modern versions of Atari-style digital joysticks are rare, typically used for retrogaming where they are referred to as an arcade controller.
