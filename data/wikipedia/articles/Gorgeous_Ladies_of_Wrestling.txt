Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, also known as GLOW or G.L.O.W., was a women's professional wrestling promotion that began in 1986 (the pilot was filmed in December 1985) and continued in various forms after it left television. Colorful characters, strong women, and over-the-top comedy sketches were integral to the series' success. Most of the performers were actresses, models, dancers or stunt women hoping to enter show business.
