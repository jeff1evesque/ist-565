Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and the captain of the national team as of  August 2018. A right-handed top order batsman, has the fifth-highest number of centuries (fifty eight) in international cricket—twenty-three in Test cricket and thirty-five in One Day Internationals (ODI)—as of  August 2018. Kohli made his ODI debut against Sri Lanka in August 2008, and scored his first century the following year when he made 107 against the same team at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. His 86-ball 133 not out against Sri Lanka in February 2012 led India to the second highest run-chase by any team in Australia. Former Australian cricketer Dean Jones described the innings as "one of the greatest ODI knocks of all time". Kohli's highest score of 183 came against Pakistan during the 2012 Asia Cup; India successfully chased a target of 330 set by Pakistan and Kohli was adjudged man of the match. Following that in 2013, he made his first century as a captain while playing against the West Indies in a tri-nation tournament. In the bilateral series against Australia in October 2013, Kohli made two centuries in successful run chases. The first of the two, 100 not out, was scored off 52 balls and remains the fastest ODI century by an Indian. The next century, which came off 61 balls, remains the third-fastest by an Indian as of  August 2018. Twenty-one of his thirty-five centuries in ODIs have come in the second innings, and India have lost only five ODIs when he made a century. As of  August 2018, Kohli has the most ODI centuries for an active player and is behind Sachin Tendulkar (forty-nine) in the all-time list.Kohli made his Test debut against the West Indies in 2011 and scored his first century in the format during the Australian tour in January 2012. In the first Test of the 2014–15 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, he made 115 and 141, and became the fourth Indian player to score centuries in both the innings of a Test match. He was appointed as the captain of the Test team during the series and became the first player to score centuries in each of his first three Test innings as captain. In 2016, Kohli became the fifth player to score three or more double centuries in a calendar year. The following year, he repeated the feat by scoring three double centuries, including a career-best 243 against Sri Lanka. As of  August 2018, he has the most double centuries (six) by a captain. Thirteen of his twenty three Test centuries have been scored at venues outside India. In 2017, he became the first captain to score ten centuries across all formats of international cricket in a calendar year. Since his debut Twenty20 International match in 2010, Kohli is yet to score a century in the format; his highest score of 90 not out was against Australia in 2016.
