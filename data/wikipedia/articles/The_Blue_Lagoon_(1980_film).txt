The Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romantic survival drama film directed by Randal Kleiser and filmed on the Blue Lagoon in Malta and on Turtle Island in Fiji. The screenplay by Douglas Day Stewart was based on the 1908 novel of the same name by Henry De Vere Stacpoole. The film stars Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins. The music score was composed by Basil Poledouris and the cinematography was by NÃ©stor Almendros.
The film tells the story of two young children marooned on a tropical island paradise in the South Pacific. With neither the guidance nor the restrictions of society, emotional feelings and physical changes arise as they reach puberty and fall in love.
The film contained a substantial amount of sexual content, and both main characters were depicted in the nude. This was controversial, as Shields was 14 years old at the time of the filming. A body double was used for all of her nude scenes, and her breasts remained covered in frontal shots.
The film was overwhelmingly panned by critics.
