The Suicide Squad is the name of a fictional supervillain team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first version of the Suicide Squad debuted in The Brave and the Bold #25 (September 1959), and the second and modern version, created by John Ostrander, debuted in Legends #3 (January 1987). One of the two teams saves the world from a threatening race of savages.
The modern incarnation of the Suicide Squad is Task Force X - a team of incarcerated supervillains who carry out secret missions in exchange for reduced prison sentences. The Suicide Squad's name alludes to the dangerous nature of their missions. The team is based out of Belle Reve Penitentiary under the directorship of Amanda Waller.
Various incarnations of the Suicide Squad have existed throughout the years as depicted in several self-titled comic book series, from its origins in the Silver Age, to its modern-day Post-Crisis reimagining, to the current version that was introduced in the 2016 DC Rebirth continuity reboot. The current incarnation of the team appears in the fifth volume of the Suicide Squad comic series, and the recurring members include Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Enchantress, Harley Quinn, Katana, and Killer Croc.
The group has appeared in various adaptations, including television series and an eponymous 2016 feature film.
