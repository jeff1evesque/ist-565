Ludger Sylbaris (born 1 June 1874  – died circa 1929, aged 54), born in the fishing village of Le Prêcheur, Martinique to Eucher Sylbaris and Augusta Doreur. Ludger Sylbaris was an Afro-Caribbean man who travelled with the Barnum & Bailey circus. He had become something of an early 20th-century celebrity for being one of the very few survivors in the city of Saint-Pierre during the devastating volcanic eruption of Mt. Pelée on the French-Caribbean island of Martinique on May 8, 1902. The city, known as the "Paris of the West Indies", was in the direct path of a pyroclastic flow and completely flattened, killing an estimated 30,000–40,000 people.
