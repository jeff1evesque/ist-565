The Islamic faith has particular rules regarding personal hygiene when going to the toilet. This code of Muslim hygienical jurisprudence is known as Qadaa' al-Haajah. 
The only issue which the Qur'an mentions is the one of washing one's hands (verse 5:6). Issues of chirality (bodily symmetry), such as whether one uses the left or right hand, and which foot is used to step into or out of toilet areas, are derived from hadith sources.
