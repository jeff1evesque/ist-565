Robert William "Willy" Pickton (born October 24, 1949) of Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, Canada, is a Canadian serial killer convicted in 2007 of the second-degree murders of six women. Arrested in 2002, he was the subject of a lengthy investigation that yielded evidence of numerous other murders. 
He was charged with the deaths of an additional 20 women, many of them from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. But these charges were stayed by the Crown in 2010. In December 2007, Pickton was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years â€“ the longest sentence then available for murder under Canadian law.During the trial's first day of jury evidence, January 22, 2007, the Crown stated that Pickton had confessed to 49 murders to an undercover agent from the Office of Inspector General, who was posing as a cellmate. The Crown reported that Pickton told the officer that he wanted to kill another woman to make it an even 50, and that he was caught because he was "sloppy".
