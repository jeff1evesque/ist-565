Strictly Come Dancing returned for its fifteenth series with a launch show on 9 September on BBC One, with the live shows starting on 23 September 2017. Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman returned as hosts, while ZoÃ« Ball returned to host Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two on BBC Two. Bruno Tonioli, Craig Revel Horwood, and Darcey Bussell returned as judges. On 9 May 2017, it was announced that Len Goodman would be replaced by Shirley Ballas when he retired from the show. This is the first series to have two female and two male judges on the panel. 
Tonioli missed the week 5 episode due to a scheduling conflict, and was not replaced by a guest judge. Therefore, the maximum score for a pair that week was 30.In a change to the format to previous series, there was no elimination in the final, hence there were three runner-up couples this series. The series was won by Holby City actor Joe McFadden and his professional partner Katya Jones. McFadden was both the first Scottish celebrity and the oldest, at 42 years old, to win the show. Another 'Strictly' record was broken as Alexandra Burke scored the most "10s" in the history of the show with 32 surpassing the record set by Series 7 runner-up Ricky Whittle of 28.
