Adrián Beltré Pérez (born April 7, 1979) is a Dominican professional baseball third baseman playing for the Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball (MLB). Originally signed as an amateur free agent, he made his MLB debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1998 at age 19. He subsequently played for the Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, and Rangers. He bats and throws right-handed. He has since become one of the most all-around accomplished players in history; he ranks 13th in defensive Wins Above Replacement and is the fourth third baseman to reach 400 home runs and 1,500 runs batted in. Beltré is a four-time selection for the Silver Slugger Award and MLB All-Star Game, and a five-time winner of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award.
Beltré is the all-time hits leader among foreign-born players. The fifth major leaguer to hit at least 100 home runs for three different teams, he has hit at least 20 home runs in 12 different seasons, and in five, driven in at least 100 runs.  He hit a major league-leading 48 home runs while playing for the Dodgers in 2004, was the team MVP of the Red Sox in 2010, and tied for the major league lead in hits in 2013 while playing for the Rangers.
