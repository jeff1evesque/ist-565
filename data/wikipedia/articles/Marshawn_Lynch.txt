Marshawn Terrell Lynch (born April 22, 1986) is an American football running back for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft after playing college football at the University of California at Berkeley, where he became the school's second all-time career rusher. As a member of the Seattle Seahawks, he won Super Bowl XLVIII against the Denver Broncos. After initially retiring after the 2015 season, Lynch applied for reinstatement and was traded to the Raiders in April 2017. Lynch earned the nickname "Beast Mode" for his powerful running style and consistent ability to run over defenders and break tackles.
