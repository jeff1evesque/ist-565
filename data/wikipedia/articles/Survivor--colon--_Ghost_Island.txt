Survivor: Ghost Island is the 36th season of the American CBS competitive reality television series Survivor. Ghost Island was filmed in the summer of 2017 and premiered on February 28, 2018, on CBS with a two-hour episode. The season concluded on May 23, 2018. This season was the fifth to be filmed in Fiji.
This season marks the first time in Survivor history in which two players were tied for having the most jury votes at the Final Tribal Council. Domenick Abbate and Wendell Holland each received five votes from the jury, while Laurel Johnson received none. By extension, this is the first time since Survivor: Borneo that the votes were read at Final Tribal Council. In order to break the tie, Johnson joined the jury and used her deciding vote to reward the title of Sole Survivor to Holland.
