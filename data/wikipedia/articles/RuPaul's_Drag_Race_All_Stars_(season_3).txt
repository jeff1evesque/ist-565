A new twist on how the top queens of the season were chosen was revealed in the seasons last episode. The previously eliminated queens returned in the finale and voted for the top two out of the remaining top four finalists, from there on the two queens with the most votes advanced and the others were subsequently eliminated. The prizes for the winner of the competition are a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $100,000.
The winner of the third season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars was Trixie Mattel, with Kennedy Davenport being the runner-up.
