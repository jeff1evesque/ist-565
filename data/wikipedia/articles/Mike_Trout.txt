He throws and bats right-handed, stands 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall, and weighs 235 pounds (107 kg). Trout is nicknamed "The Millville Meteor."
Trout was a first-round pick by the Angels in the 2009 MLB draft and made a brief major league appearance in 2011. He became a regular player for the Angels the subsequent season and won the 2012 AL Rookie of the Year Award unanimously. He is under contract with the Angels through 2020.
Trout's athleticism on the field has received praise from both the mainstream media and sabermetricians. He is regarded as one of the most outstanding young players in the history of baseball, as well as one of the best current players in all of MLB. Trout led the American League in wins above replacement (WAR) in each of his first five full seasons (according to Fangraphs and Baseball-Reference.com).
