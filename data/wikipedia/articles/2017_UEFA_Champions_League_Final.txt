The 2017 UEFA Champions League Final was the final match of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League, the 62nd season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 25th season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales on 3 June 2017, between Italian side Juventus and Spanish side and title holders Real Madrid, in a repeat of the 1998 final. Real Madrid won the match 4–1 to secure their 12th title in this competition. With this victory, as the defending champions, Real Madrid became the first ever team to successfully defend their title in the Champions League era, and the first to do so since Milan in 1990. On the other hand, Juventus lost a fifth final in a row and a seventh in nine finals reached.
Real Madrid qualified as the UEFA representative at the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and also earned the right to play against the winners of the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, Manchester United, in the 2017 UEFA Super Cup.
