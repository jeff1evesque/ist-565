The President of Mexico
(Spanish: Presidente de México), officially known as the President of the United Mexican States (Spanish: Presidente de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos), is the head of state and government of Mexico. Under the Constitution, the president is also the Supreme Commander of the Mexican armed forces. The current President is Enrique Peña Nieto, who took office on December 1, 2012. Andrés Manuel López Obrador won the presidential election on July 1, 2018 to become President-elect.
Currently, the office of the President is considered to be revolutionary, in that the powers of office are derived from the Revolutionary Constitution of 1917. Another legacy of the Revolution is its ban on re-election.  Mexican presidents are limited to a single six-year term, called a sexenio.  No one who has held the post, even on a caretaker basis, is allowed to run or serve again. The constitution and the office of the President closely follow the presidential system of government.
