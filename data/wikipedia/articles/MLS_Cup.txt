The MLS Cup is the post-season championship match of Major League Soccer (MLS).  The winner is crowned champion in the same manner as in other North American sports leagues (i.e. via a playoff following a regular season).  This differs from other top soccer leagues around the world which consider the club with the most points at the end of the season to be the sole champion. MLS honors that achievement with the Supporters' Shield. An American team that wins the MLS Cup is awarded a berth in the following year's CONCACAF Champions League.The league hosted its inaugural championship, MLS Cup '96 on October 20, 1996. Today the MLS Cup is typically held in early December, featuring the winners of the Eastern Conference Championship and Western Conference Championship. LA Galaxy are the most successful team, winning a record fifth Cup in 2014.
During its history, the MLS Cup has been represented by three different trophies: the Alan I. Rothenberg Trophy from 1996 through 1998, a redesigned Alan I. Rothenberg Trophy from 1999 through 2007, and the Philip F. Anschutz Trophy since 2008.
