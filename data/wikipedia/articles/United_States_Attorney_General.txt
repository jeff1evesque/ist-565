The United States Attorney General (A.G.) is the head of the United States Department of Justice per 28 U.S.C. ยง 503, concerned with all legal affairs, and is the chief lawyer of the United States government. In cases of the federal death penalty, the power to seek the death penalty rests with the Attorney General.
Under the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, the Attorney General is nominated by the President and appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The Constitution provides that civil officers of the United States, which would include the Attorney General, may be impeached by Congress for treason, bribery, or "high crimes and misdemeanors". The Attorney General may be removed at will by the President under the Supreme Court decision Myers v. United States, which found that the President may remove executive branch officials without the consent of the Senate or any other entity.  The common law further suggests that the President has the power to remove an official engaged in purely executive functions or an official whose duties immediately affect the President's ability to fulfill his constitutional responsibilities, (Bowsher v. Synar, 1986).
