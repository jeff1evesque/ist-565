Divya Om Prakash Bharti (25 February 1974 â€“ 5 April 1993) was an Indian film actress, who starred in a number of successful Hindi and Telugu motion pictures in the early 1990s. Known for her acting versatility, vivacity and beauty, she is regarded as one of the most popular and highest-paid actresses of her time.
Bharti aspired a career in films at a young age, and started to get offers at age 14, while she was doing some modelling assignments. After several unsuccessful attempts, she made her debut with a lead role in the successful Telugu drama Bobbili Raja (1990), aged 16. After featuring in a number of high-grossing Telugu films, she progressed to Bollywood films in 1992 with the action thriller Vishwatma. Bharti went on to have commercial success alongside acclaimed actors such as Govinda and Rishi Kapoor in films like Shola Aur Shabnam and Deewana, respectively; the latter of which garnered her a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut. She acted in over 14 Hindi films between 1992 and 1993, which is to date an unbroken record in Hindi cinema. Although a teenager, Bharti played adult roles in all her films.
Bharti died on 5 April 1993, aged 19, from head injuries sustained after falling off the balcony of her fifth-floor apartment at Versova, Mumbai.
