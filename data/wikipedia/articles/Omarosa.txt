Omarose Onee Manigault Newman (; born February 5, 1974), often known mononymously as Omarosa, is an American reality television show participant, writer, and former political aide to President Donald Trump. She initially rose to fame as a contestant on the first season of NBC's reality television series The Apprentice.
On 4 January 2017, it was announced she would serve as assistant to the President and director of communications for the Office of Public Liaison during the Trump administration. However, on 13 December 2017, Omarosa's resignation from the White House was announced. Shortly after, she competed on Celebrity Big Brother and made it to the final five of the season.
In August 2018, Omarosa released Unhinged, a book which details her tenure at the White House and criticizes Trump and his administration. Two days before the book was released, Omarosa released the first of as many as 200 secret tapes she recorded during her White House tenure. As of 26 August 2018, she has released four tapes. The first tape she released, which was secretly recorded inside the Situation Room, was described as "one of the worst White House security breaches ever."  However, Omarosa's tape is thought not to violate the Espionage Act.
