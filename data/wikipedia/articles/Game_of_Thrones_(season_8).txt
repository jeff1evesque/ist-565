The eighth and final season of the fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones was announced by HBO in July 2016. Unlike the first six seasons that each had ten episodes and the seventh that had seven episodes, the eighth season will have only six episodes. Like the previous season, it will largely consist of original content not found currently in George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series and will instead adapt material Martin has revealed to showrunners about the upcoming novels in the series, The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring.
The season will be adapted for television by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Filming officially began on October 23, 2017, and concluded in July 2018. The season is scheduled to premiere during the first half of 2019.
