Colleen "CoCo" Vandeweghe ( VAN-d…ô-way) (born December 6, 1991) is an American professional tennis player. A former Junior US Open champion at the age of 16, she has also won two WTA titles, both at the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships in Den Bosch. In 2017, she reached two Grand Slam semifinals and the final of the WTA Elite Trophy to move up to a career-high ranking of No. 9. In addition to her two Grand Slam semifinals in 2017 at the Australian Open and US Open, Vandeweghe has twice reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, in 2015 and 2017.
Despite being predominantly a singles player, Vandeweghe also excels at doubles. In 2016, she partnered with Martina Hingis in much of the second half of the season and reached the semifinals of the US Open, a performance that lifted her to a career-high ranking of No. 18 in the world. In that same year, she also reached two Grand Slam mixed-doubles finals at the Australian Open and at the US Open.
Vandeweghe's prowess at both singles and doubles helped her win all eight of her Fed Cup rubbers in 2017 across three different ties to lead the United States to their first Fed Cup championship since 2000.
