Matthew Thomas Holliday (born January 15, 1980) is an American professional baseball left fielder and first baseman for the Colorado Rockies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played in MLB for the Rockies, Oakland Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals and New York Yankees.  A World Series champion in 2011 with the Cardinals, Holliday, through prodigious hitting contributions, has played a key role in seven postseasons, including the Rockies' first-ever World Series appearance in 2007 and Cardinals' playoff success of the 2010s.  His distinctions include a National League (NL) batting championship, the 2007 NL Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award (NLCS MVP), seven All-Star selections, and four Silver Slugger Awards.  Other career accomplishments include 300 home runs, more than 2,000 hits, 100 stolen bases, and batting over .300 eight times.
The Colorado Rockies selected Holliday in the seventh round of the 1998 MLB draft from high school in Oklahoma, where he also starred as a highly touted quarterback prospect.  He debuted in MLB in 2004, becoming the Rockies' starting left fielder and a middle of the lineup presence.  In 2006, he became the 19th player ever to reach 195 hits, 30 home runs, 45 doubles, 115 runs and 110 runs batted in (RBI) in one season.  The next season, he won the NL batting title, September National League Player of the Month honors and NLCS MVP as the Rockies won 21 of 22 games at the end of the regular season and in the playoffs en route to their first World Series appearance.  In the first of four consecutive NLCS appearances starting in 2011, he batted .435 with a .652 slugging percentage in the 2011 NLCS on his way to winning his first World Series ring with the Cardinals.  In 2014, he became just the fifth player in MLB history to amass nine consecutive seasons of at least 20 home runs, 30 doubles, 75 RBI and 80 runs scored each season.
In addition to his presence as a leader on the field, Holliday is active in charity work and assisting his teammates off the field.  Thus, the St. Louis chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America has awarded him the Darryl Kile Good Guy Award.  He is a frequent visitor to children's hospitals.  From 2012 to 2016, Holliday co-sponsored a pledge drive for Greater St. Louis hospitals called "Homers for Health," which raised more than $3.7 million.  Because of his hitting abilities and strength, he has sometimes been called the "Stillwater Stinger."
