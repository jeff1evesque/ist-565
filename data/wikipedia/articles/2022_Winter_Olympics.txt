These Games will be the first Winter Olympics ever to be held in China, and the last of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. These Games will also be the fourth Winter Olympics to be held in East Asia, after Sapporo (1972), Nagano (1998) and Pyeongchang (2018). Beijing will become the first city ever to host both Summer and Winter Olympic Games. There are plans to utilize many of the same indoor venues that were used in 2008, as well as using the Beijing National Stadium for the opening and closing ceremonies.
