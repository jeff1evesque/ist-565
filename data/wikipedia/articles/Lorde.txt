"Royals" was released as Lorde's debut single in mid-2013, becoming an international crossover hit and peaking atop many national charts. At 17, it made her the youngest solo artist to achieve a number-one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 since 1987.

In 2014, Lorde curated the soundtrack for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay â€“ Part 1 (2014) and provided its lead single, "Yellow Flicker Beat", for which she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

The record deals with themes of heartbreak and solitude.
Lorde's music consists of subgenres such as dream pop and indietronica. She chose her stage name due to her fascination with "royals and aristocracy".
