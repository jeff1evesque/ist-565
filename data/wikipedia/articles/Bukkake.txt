Bukkake (Japanese: ぶっかけ, [bɯkkake] ( listen); English:  buu-KAK-ay) is a sex act portrayed in pornographic films, in which several men ejaculate on a woman, or on another man. Bukkake videos are a relatively prevalent niche in contemporary pornographic films. Originating in Japan in the 1980s, the genre subsequently spread to North America and Europe, and crossed over into gay pornography.
