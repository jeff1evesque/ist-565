Sophia Christina Amoruso (born April 20, 1984) is an American businesswoman. At age 22, she started an online eBay store selling vintage clothing and other items, which she named "Nasty Gal Vintage".
Based on the success of her online store, Amoruso founded Nasty Gal, a women's fashion retailer, which went on to be named one of "the fastest growing companies" by Inc. Magazine in 2012. In 2016, she was named one of the richest self-made women in the world by Forbes. Soon, however, Nasty Gal filed for bankruptcy, decimating her fortune.
