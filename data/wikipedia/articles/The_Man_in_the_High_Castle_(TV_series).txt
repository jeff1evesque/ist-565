The Man in the High Castle is an American dystopian alternate history television series, produced by Amazon Studios, Scott Free Productions, Headline Pictures, Electric Shepherd Productions, and Big Light Productions. The series is based on the 1962 novel of the same name by Philip K. Dick. In the series' alternate version of 1962, the Axis powers have won World War II and divided the United States into the Greater Nazi Reich, comprising more than half of eastern part of the continent, and the Japanese Pacific States to the west. These territories are separated by a neutral zone that encompasses the Rocky Mountains. The series follows characters whose destinies intertwine after they come into contact with a series of propaganda films that show a very different history from their own.
Premiering in January 2015, the pilot was Amazon's "most-watched since the original series development program began". The next month, Amazon ordered episodes to fill out a ten-episode season, which was released in November to positive reviews. A second season of ten episodes premiered in December 2016, with a third season announced a few weeks later, to be released on October 5, 2018. On July 21, 2018, it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con that the series had been renewed for a fourth season.
