Andy Murray was the defending champion but could not participate this year due to injury. As a result of the withdrawals of Murray and Novak Djokovic from the tournament, they fell outside the top-10 in the ATP rankings for the first time since September 22, 2014 and March 5, 2007, respectively.
Jack Sock won his first ATP World Tour Masters 1000 singles title, defeating Filip Krajinović in the final, 5–7, 6–4, 6–1. Sock became the first American man to win a Masters 1000 singles title since Andy Roddick in 2010. For the first time since 2004, more than three of the year's Masters 1000 singles events were won by players outside the Big Four.  The win also catapulted Sock from No. 24 in the Race to London to No. 9 which earned him the last available entry to the 2017 ATP Finals.Krajinović became the lowest-ranked player to reach the final of a Masters 1000 singles event since Andrei Pavel in 2003 and the first qualifier to achieve this feat since Jerzy Janowicz in 2012. All three of these players reached the final in the Paris Masters tournament.By winning his first match, Rafael Nadal secured the year-end ATP no. 1 singles ranking for the fourth time in his career.
