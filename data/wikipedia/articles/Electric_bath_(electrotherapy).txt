An electric bath is a 19th-century medical treatment in which high-voltage electrical apparatus was used for electrifying patients by causing an electric charge to build up on their bodies.  In the US this process was known as Franklinization after Benjamin Franklin.  The process became widely known after Franklin described it in the mid-18th century, but after that it was mostly practiced by quacks.  Golding Bird brought it into the mainstream at Guy's Hospital in the mid-19th century and it fell into disuse in the early 20th century.
