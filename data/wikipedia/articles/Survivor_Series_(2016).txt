Survivor Series (2016) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event produced by WWE for the Raw and SmackDown brands. It took place on November 20, 2016, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was the thirtieth event under the Survivor Series chronology. This was the first Survivor Series to take place in Canada since the 1997 edition, which became infamous for the Montreal Screwjob. The event was the first Survivor Series event to be four hours in length.Eight matches were contested at the event, including two on the pre-show. The main event marked the in-ring return of Goldberg after twelve years, which saw him defeat Brock Lesnar in 1 minute and 26 seconds. The other five matches on the main card were interpromotional matches, pitting wrestlers from the Raw brand against wrestlers from the SmackDown brand. Three of those matches were Survivor Series elimination matches; Raw's women and tag teams defeated SmackDown's, but SmackDown's men defeated Raw in the penultimate match. Furthermore, Intercontinental Champion The Miz (from SmackDown) and Cruiserweight Champion The Brian Kendrick (from Raw) retained their titles against challengers from the opposing brand, Raw's Sami Zayn and SmackDown's Kalisto, respectively. Had Kalisto won the Cruiserweight Championship, the entire cruiserweight division would have been transferred to SmackDown.
