Andrew Phillip Cunanan (August 31, 1969 â€“ July 23, 1997) was an American spree killer who murdered at least five people, including fashion designer Gianni Versace and Chicago tycoon Lee Miglin, during a three-month period in mid-1997. Cunanan's string of murders ended on July 23 with his suicide by firearm. He was 27 years old.
In his final years, Cunanan had lived without a specific job, befriending wealthy older men and spending their money to impress acquaintances in the local gay community, by boasting about social events at clubs and often paying the check at restaurants. One millionaire friend had broken up with Cunanan in 1996, the prior year.
