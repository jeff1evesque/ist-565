Matthew Thomas Cain (born October 1, 1984), nicknamed The Horse, Big Daddy, and Big Sugar, is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He stands 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighs 230 pounds (100 kg). Cain played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants. A three-time World Series champion, Cain is regarded as a central figure of the Giants' success in the 2010s for his pitching and leadership.
The Giants drafted Cain out of high school in 2002, and he debuted in the Major Leagues at age 21 in 2005, becoming the youngest player in the National League (NL) that year.
In 2009, Cain was named to his first career All-Star Game and won the Willie Mac Award. During the 2010 MLB Postseason, Cain did not allow an earned run in any of the three playoff games he pitched in as the Giants won their first World Series since 1954. In 2011, Cain won 12 games and had a 2.88 ERA. In 2012, Cain signed a five-year, $112.5 million contract extension, which was at the time the largest deal for a right-handed pitcher in North American sports history. Cain threw the 22nd perfect game in Major League Baseball history on June 13, 2012. He had a 16â€“5 record during the regular season, and he finished sixth in NL Cy Young Award voting. The Giants would win every series-clinching playoff game in which Cain started as they won the 2012 World Series.
