The 2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, Canada's national women's curling championship, was held from January 27–February 4, 2018 at the South Okanagan Events Centre in Penticton, British Columbia. The winning team will represent Canada at the 2018 Ford World Women's Curling Championship to be held from March 17–25 at the Memorial Gardens in North Bay, Ontario.
The 2018 tournament was the first to use a new 16-team format, featuring representation by all fourteen member associations of Curling Canada, the second-place team from the 2017 tournament (as champion Rachel Homan declined to participate due to her qualification for the 2018 Winter Olympics), and a new wildcard team. As part of this new format, the Bronze medal game was removed from the schedule.
