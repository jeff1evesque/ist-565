The Life of Pablo is the seventh studio album by American rapper and recording artist Kanye West, released on February 14, 2016 by GOOD Music and Def Jam Recordings. Recording sessions took place from 2013 to 2016 in Italy, Mexico, Canada, and the United States. Production on the album was handled by West and a variety of producers, including co-executive producers Rick Rubin and Noah Goldstein, Mike Dean, Metro Boomin, Hudson Mohawke, Plain Pat, and Madlib. He also enlisted a wide array of guest vocalists, including The Weeknd, Ty Dolla Sign, Desiigner, Kid Cudi, The-Dream, Chance the Rapper, Rihanna, Sampha, Post Malone, Kendrick Lamar, and Frank Ocean.
The Life of Pablo was preceded by several promotional singles as part of West's GOOD Fridays giveaways, including the tracks "Real Friends" and "No More Parties in LA". In the months before its release, the album's title and tracklist went through several publicized changes, and West's erratic activity on social media became the source of several controversies. An early version of the album was premiered by West at Madison Square Garden on February 11, 2016, as part of his Yeezy Season 3 fashion show in collaboration with Adidas. After several additional sessions and alterations, the album was launched exclusively through the streaming service Tidal three days later.Following its official streaming debut, West continued to make changes to The Life of Pablo, describing it as "a living, breathing, changing, creative expression" and declaring the end of the album as a dominant release form; Def Jam confirmed his intention to continue working on the album over the subsequent months. A largely updated version of the album, including alternate mixes and other changes was made available on other streaming services and for digital purchase on his website on April 1, 2016; no official CD release is planned. The album was supported by the singles "Famous", "Father Stretch My Hands", and "Fade".
The Life of Pablo received positive reviews from critics, with particular attention drawn to the fragmented, unfinished nature of its composition and release. Following Tidal's disclosure of its streaming data and the album's release to competing streaming services, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming West's seventh consecutive number-one album on the chart and the first to reach the summit primarily through streaming. In April 2017, The Life of Pablo became the first streaming-only album to go platinum, becoming West's eighth platinum-certified release. It was named among the best albums of 2016 by multiple publications, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, while "Ultralight Beam" and "Famous" were nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance and Best Rap Song.
