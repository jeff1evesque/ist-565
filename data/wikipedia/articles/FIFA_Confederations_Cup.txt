The FIFA Confederations Cup is an international association football tournament for men's national teams, currently held every four years by FIFA. It is contested by the holders of each of the six (AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL, OFC and UEFA) continental championships, along with the current FIFA World Cup holder and the host nation, to bring the number of teams up to eight.
Since 2005, the tournament has been held in the nation that will host the next World Cup, acting as a test event for the larger tournament. The 2021 tournament will be moved from 2022 World Cup host Qatar to another Asian country, due to concerns over the high temperatures that it experiences during June and July (these same concerns prompted the start of the 2022 World Cup to be moved to November instead of June).The current champions are Germany, who won the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup by defeating Chile 1â€“0 in the final to win their first title.
