Proposition 218 was an adopted initiative constitutional amendment which revolutionized local and regional government finance in California. Called the “Right to Vote on Taxes Act,” it was sponsored by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association as a constitutional follow-up to the landmark property tax revolt initiative constitutional amendment, Proposition 13, approved in 1978. Proposition 218 achieved what was originally intended by Proposition 13 by giving the final decision on taxes to local voters instead of local politicians.:1In adopting Proposition 218, California voters stated the underlying basis for the measure by declaring: “Proposition 13 was intended to provide effective tax relief and to require voter approval of tax increases. However, local governments have subjected taxpayers to excessive tax, assessment, fee and charge increases that not only frustrate the purposes of voter approval for tax increases, but also threaten the economic security of all Californians and the California economy itself. This measure protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments exact revenue from taxpayers without their consent.”Proposition 218 amended the California Constitution by adding Article XIII C and Article XIII D. Article XIII C added constitutional voter approval requirements for all local government taxes which previously did not exist. This also includes a significant provision expanding the constitutional local initiative power by voters to reduce or repeal any local government tax, assessment, fee or charge, subject to a significantly reduced signature requirement making ballot qualification much easier. Article XIII D added constitutional assessment and property-related fee reforms applicable to all local governments which also previously did not exist. This includes numerous additional requirements for special benefit assessments on real property as well as numerous requirements for property-related fees and charges, such as utility fees imposed by local governments which are no longer allowed to exceed the cost of providing the utility service.Proposition 218 is listed as one of the most significant laws of the 20th Century in California.Proposition 218 was the first successful initiative constitutional amendment in California history to add more than one article to the California Constitution, as well as to alter the scope of the constitutional initiative power.
