Akinwale Oluwafolajimi Oluwatope Arobieke (born 15 July 1961)  is an English convicted criminal. Arobieke is known locally in North West England as Purple Aki and has claimed multiple times that this nickname is racially charged, the suggestion being that his skin is so black that it looks purple. Arobieke is a 6 ft 5 in-tall (196 cm) bodybuilder who weighs 22 stone (140 kg; 310 lb).His criminal activities were originally ruled as sexually motivated, a fact which was recognised in 2006 by Liverpool Magistrates' Court, when Merseyside Police successfully applied to them for a Sexual Offences Prevention Order. The Prevention Order, however, was lifted in May 2016 and Arobieke has never been convicted of a sexual offence.In September 2016, BBC Three aired a documentary about Arobieke, The Man Who Squeezes Muscles: Searching for Purple Aki. Later that year, Arobieke made an allegation against the BBC of incitement to racial hatred; he complained to Merseyside police that the documentary was racist and demonised him.
