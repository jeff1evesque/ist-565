Ronald Antonio O'Sullivan,  (born 5 December 1975) is an English professional snooker player. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he has been described by fellow professionals and commentators as a genius.A child prodigy, O'Sullivan began playing snooker at age 7, made his first competitive century break at the age of 10, and became British Under-16 Champion at age 13. He made his first competitive maximum break in 1991, aged 15, and won the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship as well as Junior Pot Black in the same year. He turned professional in 1992, aged 16, and achieved his first major professional success when he won the 1993 UK Championship at the age of 17 years and 358 days, making him the youngest player ever to win a ranking title, a record he still holds. He is also the youngest player ever to have won the Masters, having captured his first title in 1995 at the age of 19 years and 69 days.As of 1 April 2018, O'Sullivan has won five World Championships, a record seven Masters titles, and a joint record six UK Championships, equalling Stephen Hendry's record of 18 titles in Triple Crown tournaments. His career total of 33 ranking titles is second only to Hendry's 36, while his estimated career earnings of Â£9.7 million put him in first place on snooker's all-time prize-money list.[source] A prolific break-builder, he holds the records for the most competitive century breaks (948)[source], the most ratified maximum breaks in professional competition (14), and the fastest competitive maximum break, compiled at the 1997 World Championship. Based at the Legends Snooker Academy in Leytonstone, he also plays pool, and competed on the elite International Pool Tour in 2005.Throughout his career, O'Sullivan has been noted for his mercurial temperament, and has received multiple warnings and sanctions from snooker's governing body relating to his conduct and comments. He has an ambivalent relationship with the sport, from which he has taken prolonged sabbaticals and repeatedly threatened to retire.
