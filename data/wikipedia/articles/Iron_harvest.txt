The iron harvest is the annual "harvest" of unexploded ordnance, barbed wire, shrapnel, bullets and congruent trench support collected by Belgian and French farmers after plowing their fields. The harvest generally applies to the material from World War I, which is still found in large quantities across the former Western Front.
