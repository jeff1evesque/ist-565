His team, Mercedes, is the defending World Constructors' Champion, having secured their fourth consecutive title at the 2017 United States Grand Prix.

A new cockpit protection device—commonly known as the "halo"—became mandatory starting in 2018. The introduction of the halo in Formula One was the first stage of a planned roll-out that would see the device adopted in all FIA-sanctioned open-wheel racing series by 2020.
