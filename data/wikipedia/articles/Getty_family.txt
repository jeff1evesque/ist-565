The Getty family of the United States identify with George Franklin Getty and his son Jean Paul Getty as their patriarchs. In the 20th century they were heavily involved in the petroleum industry. The Getty family is of Scots-Irish ancestry from the patrilineal lineage, their ancestors having migrated to North America from Cullavmor, in what is now County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Several members of the Getty family have lived in England, including  Sir Paul Getty who took British citizenship. The Getty family is distantly related to Samuel Gettys, founder of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
