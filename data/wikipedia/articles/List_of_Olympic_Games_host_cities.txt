This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Since then, summer games have usually –  but not always –  celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad. There have been 28  Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities, and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Tokyo/Helsinki (summer) and Sapporo/Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) in 1940; and London (summer) and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (winter) in 1944. The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games.  The Youth Olympic Games  are held every four years in staggered summer and winter events consistent with the current Olympic Games format, though in reverse order with Winter Games held in leap years instead of Summer Games. The first summer version was held in Singapore from 14 to 26 August 2010 while the first winter version was held in Innsbruck, Austria from 13 to 22 January 2012. The age limitation of the athletes is 14 to 18. Jacques Rogge, IOC President, formally announced plans for the Youth Olympic Games at the 119th IOC session in Guatemala City on 6 July 2007.  There are several goals for the YOG, and four of them include bringing together the world's best young athletes, offering an introduction into Olympism, innovating in educating and debating Olympic values.  The city of Singapore was announced as the host of the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics on 21 February 2008.  On 12 December 2008 the IOC announced that Innsbruck, host of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics, would be the host of the inaugural Winter Youth Olympics in 2012.
Seven cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games and Youth Olympic Games: Buenos Aires for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, Lausanne for the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics, Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics, Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics, either Abuja, Dakar, Gaborone or Tunis for the 2022 Summer Youth Olympics, Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics, and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics.
In 2022, Beijing will become the only city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games. Ten cities will have hosted the Olympic Games more than once: Athens (1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics), Paris (1900, 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics), London (1908, 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics), St. Moritz (1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics), Lake Placid (1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics), Los Angeles (1932, 1984 and 2028 Summer Olympics), Innsbruck (1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics and 2012 Winter Youth Olympics), Tokyo (1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics), Lillehammer (1994 Winter Olympics and 2016 Winter Youth Olympics) and Beijing (2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics). In addition, Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics. London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics. Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics, followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028. The United States has hosted a total of eight Olympic Games, more than any other country, followed by France with five editions. Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Austria, Canada, Italy, Japan and Germany have each hosted three Games.
The Games have primarily been hosted in the continents of Europe (32 editions) and North America (12 editions); seven Games have been hosted in Asia and two have been hosted in Oceania. In 2010, Singapore became Southeast Asia's first Olympic host city for the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics, while Rio de Janeiro became South America's first Olympic host city with the 2016 Summer Olympics, followed by Buenos Aires with the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics. The 2022 Summer Youth Olympics in either Abuja, Dakar, Gaborone or Tunis will become the first Games to be held on the African continent. Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean.
Host cities are selected by the IOC membership, usually seven years in advance. The selection process lasts approximately two years. In the first stage, any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city. After 10 months, the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant city will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications. In a second stage, the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission, which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection. The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session, a general meeting of IOC members.
