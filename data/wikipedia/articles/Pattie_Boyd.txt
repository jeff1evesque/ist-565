Patricia Anne Boyd (born 17 March 1944) is an English model and photographer. She was one of the leading international models during the 1960s and, with Jean Shrimpton, epitomised the British female "look" of the era. Boyd was married to George Harrison and experienced the height of the Beatles' popularity as well as sharing in their embrace of Indian spirituality. She later married and divorced Harrison's friend, guitarist Eric Clapton. Boyd inspired Harrison's songs such as "If I Needed Someone", "Something" and "For You Blue", and Clapton's "Layla" and "Wonderful Tonight".
In August 2007, Boyd published her autobiography Wonderful Today (titled Wonderful Tonight in the United States). Her photographs of Harrison and Clapton, titled Through the Eye of a Muse, have been exhibited in Dublin, Sydney, Toronto, Moscow, London, Almaty, Uppsala and throughout the United States.
