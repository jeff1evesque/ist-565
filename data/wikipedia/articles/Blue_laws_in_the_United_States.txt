Blue laws in the United States vary by state. Blue laws are laws designed to enforce religious standards. Many states prohibit selling alcoholic beverages for on- and off-premises sales in one form or another on Sundays at some restricted time. Blue laws may also prohibit retail activity on days such as Sunday.
Erwin Fahlbusch and Geoffrey William Bromiley write that throughout their existence, first-day Sabbatarian organizations have been supported by labor unions in lobbying "to prevent secular and commercial interests from hampering freedom of worship and from exploiting workers." For example, the United States Congress was supported by the Lord's Day Alliance in securing "a day of rest for city postal clerks whose hours of labor, unlike those of city mail carriers, were largely unregulated."
