June Gibbons (born 11 April 1963) and Jennifer Gibbons (11 April 1963 - 9 March 1993) were identical twins who grew up in Wales. They became known as "The Silent Twins" since they only communicated with each other. They began writing works of fiction but later turned to crime. Both women were admitted to Broadmoor Hospital where they were held for 11 years.
