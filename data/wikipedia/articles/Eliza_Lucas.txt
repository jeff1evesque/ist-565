Eliza Lucas Pinckney (December 28, 1722 â€“ May 26, 1793) changed agriculture in colonial South Carolina, where she developed indigo as one of its most important cash crops. Its cultivation and processing as dye produced one-third the total value of the colony's exports before the Revolutionary War. Manager of three plantations, Mrs. Pinckney had a major influence on the colonial economy.
In the 20th century, Eliza Pinckney was the first woman to be inducted into South Carolina's Business Hall of Fame.
