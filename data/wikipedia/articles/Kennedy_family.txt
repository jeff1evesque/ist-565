The Kennedy family is an American political family that has long been prominent in American politics, public service, and business. The first Kennedy was elected to public office in 1884, 35 years after the family's arrival from Ireland. At least one Kennedy family member held federal elective office in every year since 1947 until Patrick J. Kennedy stepped down from his congressional seat in Rhode Island, a span of time comprising more than a quarter of the United States' existence.The descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy include a president of the United States (who had also served in both houses of Congress), a U.S. attorney general (who later served in the U.S. Senate), four other members of the United States House of Representatives or Senate, and two U.S. ambassadors, a lieutenant governor, three state legislators (one of whom went on to the U.S. House of Representatives), and one mayor.
In addition, Joseph Sr. and Rose's daughter, Eunice, founded the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (a part of the National Institutes of Health), and founded the Special Olympics. A granddaughter,  Maria Shriver, was married to Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and bodybuilder who later served as California governor; as First Lady of California, she was instrumental in creating the California Museum for History, Women and the Arts (now the California Museum).. Other descendants of Joseph and Rose Kennedy have been active as lawyers, authors, and activists on behalf of those with physical and intellectual challenges.
