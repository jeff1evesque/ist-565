Dianne Goldman Berman Feinstein (; born Dianne Emiel Goldman, June 22, 1933) is an American politician serving as the senior United States Senator from California, a seat she has held since 1992. A member of the Democratic Party, she previously was Mayor of San Francisco from 1978 to 1988.Born in San Francisco, Feinstein graduated from Stanford University in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts in history. In the 1960s, she worked in city government, and in 1969, she was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. She served as the board's first female president in 1978, during which time the assassinations of Mayor George Moscone and City Supervisor Harvey Milk drew national attention. Feinstein succeeded Moscone as Mayor of San Francisco and became the first woman to assume the position. During her tenure, she led renovation of the city's cable car system, and oversaw the 1984 Democratic National Convention.
After a failed gubernatorial campaign in 1990, she won a 1992 special election to the U.S. Senate. Feinstein was first elected on the same ballot as her peer Barbara Boxer, and the two became California's first female U.S. Senators. Feinstein has been re-elected four times since then and in the 2012 election, she claimed the record for the most popular votes in any U.S. Senate election in history, having received 7.75 million votes.Feinstein was the author of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban which expired in 2004. In 2013, she introduced a new assault weapons bill, which failed to pass. Feinstein is the first and only woman to have chaired the Senate Rules Committee (2007â€“2009) and the Select Committee on Intelligence from 2009 to 2015, when the Democrats lost control of the Senate. She is the only woman to have presided over a U.S. presidential inauguration. At the age of 85, Feinstein is the oldest currently serving United States Senator. With the retirement of Barbara Mikulski, Feinstein is the longest current-serving female U.S. Senator. In October 2017, Feinstein officially declared her intention to run for re-election in 2018, and she subsequently lost the endorsement of the California Democratic Party for the 2018 general election.
