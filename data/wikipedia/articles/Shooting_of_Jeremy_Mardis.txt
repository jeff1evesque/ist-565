On November 3, 2015, Jeremy Mardis, a six-year-old boy, was killed in Marksville, Louisiana, in a police shooting that also wounded his father Chris Few. Two Marksville law enforcement officers, Derrick Stafford and Norris Greenhouse Jr., were arrested on charges of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder as a result of the incident. The evidence from a police body-worn video camera was cited as being contributory to the speed of the arrests.
