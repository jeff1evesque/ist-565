Pancasila (Indonesian: [pantʃaˈsila]) is the official, foundational philosophical theory of the Indonesian state. Pancasila comprises two Old Javanese words originally derived from Sanskrit: "pañca" ("five") and "sīla" ("principles"). Thus it is composed of five principles and contends that they are inseparable and interrelated:

Belief in the One and Only God (in Indonesian "Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa"),
A just and civilized humanity (in Indonesian "Kemanusiaan Yang Adil dan Beradab"),
A unified Indonesia (in Indonesian "Persatuan Indonesia"),
Democracy, led by the wisdom of the representatives of the People (in Indonesian "Kerakyatan Yang Dipimpin oleh Hikmat Kebijaksanaan, Dalam Permusyawaratan Perwakilan")
Social justice for all Indonesians (in Indonesian "Keadilan Sosial bagi seluruh Rakyat Indonesia").
