The Bagel Bakers Local 338 was a trade union local that was established in the early 1900s in New York City and whose craftsmen were the primary makers of New York's bagels, prepared by hand, until the advent of machine-made bagels in the 1960s led to its end as an independent organization in the 1970s. It was a local union of the Bakery and Confectionery Workers International Union. Until 1964, the union used a different transliteration and called itself the Beigel Bakers Union.
