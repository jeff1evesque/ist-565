The tournament was won by Italy, who defeated West Germany 3–1 during the final match, held in the Spanish capital of Madrid.  It was Italy's third World Cup win and first since 1938. The defending champions Argentina were eliminated in the second group round. Algeria, Cameroon, Honduras, Kuwait and New Zealand made their first appearances in the finals.
