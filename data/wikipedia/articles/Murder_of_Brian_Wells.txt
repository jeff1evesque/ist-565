Brian Douglas Wells (November 15, 1956 â€“ August 28, 2003) was an American man who died after becoming involved in a complex plot involving a bank robbery, a scavenger hunt, and a homemade explosive device. He was killed when an explosive collar detonated while he was in police custody in his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania; the collar had been forcibly locked onto his neck as part of the plot. The crime was investigated by a task force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in conjunction with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Pennsylvania State Police and was described as "one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI". It has been debated whether or not Wells was a willing participant, but the story was the subject of significant attention in the mass media.
In a July 2007 indictment, federal prosecutors alleged that Wells had been involved in planning the botched bank robbery. His co-conspirators Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of bank robbery and conspiracy, as well as weapons charges. In 2008, U.S. District Judge Sean J. McLaughlin sentenced Barnes to 45 years in federal prison. Two years later, Diehl-Armstrong was also found guilty and was sentenced to life in prison in 2011, where she died in 2017.
