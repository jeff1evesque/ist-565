Humayun Saqib Muazzam Khan (September 9, 1976 â€“ June 8, 2004) was a United States Army officer. Born in the United Arab Emirates to Pakistani parents, he moved to the U.S. with his family as a young boy. He attended the University of Virginia, where he was a member of the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Upon graduating in 2000, Khan was commissioned an officer in the United States Army and was deployed as a captain to Iraq during the Iraq War. In 2004 he was killed in a suicide attack near Baqubah, Iraq, and was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star. 
Khan's name came to national attention during the 2016 presidential campaign as an example of Muslim Americans serving in the military. At the 2016 Democratic National Convention, his father Khizr Khan, standing at the podium with his wife (and Humayun's mother) Ghazala, delivered a speech condemning U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump's statements on Muslims.
