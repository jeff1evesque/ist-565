Falcon 9 is a family of two-stage-to-orbit medium lift launch vehicles, named for its use of nine Merlin first-stage engines, designed and manufactured by SpaceX. Variants include the initial v1.0 (expendable), v1.1 (partially-reusable), and current "Full Thrust" v1.2 (partially-reusable). The Falcon 9 is powered by rocket engines using liquid oxygen (LOX) and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellants.
The current "Full Thrust" version can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms (50,300 lb) to low Earth orbit, and up to 8,300 kg (18,300 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), when flying in expendable mode. The first stage can be recovered and reused for GTO payloads up to 5,500 kg (12,100 lb) automatically landing after disconnection of the second stage. The Falcon 9 has been subsequently upgraded and uprated; on July 22, 2018 a Falcon 9 launched the Telstar 19V 7,075 kg (15,598 lb) satellite into a sub-synchronous transfer orbit, also called a GTO- orbit.In 2008, SpaceX won a Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract in NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program to deliver cargo to the International Space Station (ISS) using the Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule. The first mission under this contract launched in October 2012. SpaceX intends to certify the Falcon 9 to be human-rated for transporting NASA astronauts to the ISS as part of the Commercial Crew Development program.
The initial Falcon 9 version 1.0 flew five times from June 2010 to March 2013; version 1.1 flew fifteen times from September 2013 to January 2016. The "Full Thrust" version has been in service since December 2015, with several additional upgrades within this version. The latest variant of it, Block 5, was introduced in May 2018. It features increased engine thrust, improved landing legs, and other minor improvements to help recovery and reuse. The Falcon Heavy derivative, introduced February 2018, groups three Falcon 9 first stages together side by side.
