This article is a collection of statewide polls for the United States presidential election, 2016. The polls listed here provide early data on opinion polling between the Democratic candidate, the Republican candidate, the Libertarian candidate, and the Green candidate. Prior to the parties' conventions, presumptive candidates were included in the polls. Not all states will conduct polling for the election due to various factors. States that are considered swing states usually put out more polls as more attention is given to the results. For determining a statistical tie, the margin of error provided by the polling source is applied to the result for each candidate.  This article displays each candidate's potential electoral vote total and is not a prediction of the current state of the election.
