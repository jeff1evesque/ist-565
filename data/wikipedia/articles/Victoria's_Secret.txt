Victoria's Secret is an American designer, manufacturer, and marketer of women's lingerie, womenswear, and beauty products. Founded in 1977 as a response to packaged underwear, which the company's founder considered to be "ugly, floral-print nylon nightgowns", the company is now the largest American retailer of women's lingerie.
