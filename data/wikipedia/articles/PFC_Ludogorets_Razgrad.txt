Professional Football Club Ludogorets 1945 Razgrad (Bulgarian: ПФК Лудогорец Разград), commonly known as Ludogorets Razgrad or simply Ludogorets, is a Bulgarian professional association football club based in Razgrad, which currently competes in the First Professional Football League, the top-tier of the Bulgarian football league system.
In their inaugural 2011–12 season in A Group after promotion, Ludogorets became the first Bulgarian team to win a treble by capturing the league championship, the Bulgarian Cup and the Bulgarian Supercup, and only the second club in the history of association football to do so. Subsequently, the club made a significant international impact in the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League, where they reached the knockout phase of the tournament in their second only European run. Ludogorets are also the second Bulgarian team, after Levski Sofia, to enter the group stage of the UEFA Champions League, a feat which they achieved in the following 2014–15 season. During that same campaign, they became the first Bulgarian team to score points in the modern Champions League group stage following a 1–0 win over Basel in Sofia.
Since their introduction to the Bulgarian top-flight, Ludogorets have established themselves as a dominant force in Bulgarian football, claiming every possible league title since then. They have also won the Bulgarian Cup twice and the Bulgarian Supercup on three occasions.The club's name stems from the Bulgarian name of the geographical region in which Razgrad is located – the Ludogorie region (meaning "region of wild forests") of northeastern Bulgaria. Ludogorets are nicknamed The Eagles, and in 2014, they were presented with a live eagle by UEFA Europa League opponents Lazio; the mascot was named Fortuna.Ludogorets' traditional home colours are green and white. The club's home ground is the Ludogorets Arena in Razgrad, a stadium with a capacity of 11,000 seats, which is currently being expanded to accommodate 12,500 spectators.
