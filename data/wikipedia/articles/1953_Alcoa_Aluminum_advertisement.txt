In 1953 Alcoa Aluminum produced an advertisement promoting their HyTop twist-off bottle cap. The advertisement, often erroneously attributed to Del Monte Foods, featured a picture of a woman with the tagline "you mean a woman can open it?" The advertisement has been subject to criticism in later reviews and is viewed as a symbol of casual sexism in the United States in the 1950s.
