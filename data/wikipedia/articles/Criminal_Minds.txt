Criminal Minds is an American police procedural crime drama television series created and produced by Jeff Davis. It originally aired on the CBS network on September 22, 2005, and has run for thirteen seasons.
It tells the story of a group of behavioral profilers who work for the FBI, as members of their Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). The team focus on profiling the criminal, called the "unsub" or "unknown subject", rather than solely investigating the crime. The show follows the team as they work cases, and tackle their personal struggles.
The show has an ensemble cast, with Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin), Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson), Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore), Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), Jennifer Jareau (A. J. Cook), and Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) as the original lineup. Throughout the show's later seasons, the characters Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), David Rossi (Joe Mantegna), Ashley Seaver (Rachel Nichols), Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn), Kate Callahan (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Tara Lewis (Aisha Tyler), Luke Alvez (Adam Rodriguez), Stephen Walker (Damon Gupton), and Matt Simmons (Daniel Henney) were introduced.
Upon release, Criminal Minds has gained critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, directing, and writing. It has also become a ratings hit for CBS, regularly featuring as one of the network's most-watched cable shows throughout its decade-long run. The show's success has spawned a media franchise, with several spinoffs, including a South Korean adaptation and a video game. Following the conclusion of the thirteenth season, CBS renewed the show for a fourteenth season, set to air on October 3, 2018.
