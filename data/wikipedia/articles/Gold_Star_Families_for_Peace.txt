Gold Star Families for Peace (GSFP) is a United States-based organization founded in January 2005 by individuals who lost family members in the Iraq War, and are thus entitled to display a Gold Star.  It is considered an offshoot of Military Families Speak Out.  Gold Star Families for Peace now includes more than 65 families of troops killed in Iraq.
Joining with organizations including Veterans for Peace, United for Peace and Justice, Code Pink, Military Families Speak Out, the Crawford Peace House and others, GSFP is actively protesting US military action in Iraq. They have used speaking engagements, congressional testimony and protests throughout the United States.
GSFP regarded the George W. Bush administration's reasons for those operations as falsehoods and grounds for impeachment of George Bush.
