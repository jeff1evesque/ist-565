Super Mario Odyssey is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is a Super Mario game that follows Mario and Cappy, a spirit that turns into Mario's hat and allows him to possess other characters and objects, as they journey across various worlds to save Princess Peach from his nemesis Bowser, who plans to forcibly marry her. Super Mario Odyssey was released worldwide on October 27, 2017. In contrast to the linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, exploration-based gameplay featured in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.
Development began after the release of Super Mario 3D World in 2013. Various ideas were suggested during development, and to incorporate them all, the team decided to employ a sandbox-style of gameplay. Unlike previous installments such as New Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario 3D World, which were aimed at a casual audience, the team designed Super Mario Odyssey to appeal to the series' core fans. The game also features a vocal theme song, "Jump Up, Super Star!", a first for the series. It received acclaim from critics, with many calling it one of the best in the series. The game was nominated for and won numerous awards, including for Game of the Year. It is the bestselling game for the Switch, with over 11 million copies sold by June 2018.
