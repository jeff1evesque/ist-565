As originally introduced, Farouk was a human mutant from Egypt who used  his vast telepathic abilities for evil, taking the alias Shadow King. Later writers established Farouk as only the modern incarnation of an ancient evil entity that has been around since the dawn of humanity, who became one with Farouk when he grew older.The character has appeared in various adaptations of X-Men stories, including X-Men: The Animated Series and Wolverine and the X-Men. He made his live-action debut in the television series Legion. In early episodes he appeared as a mental apparition known as the “Devil With the Yellow Eyes” (played by Quinton Boisclair), later taking on multiple forms including a woman named Lenny Busker (Aubrey Plaza). In season two of Legion, his true form, Amahl Farouk, is played by Navid Negahban.
