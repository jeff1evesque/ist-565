Elimination Chamber (2017) (known as No Escape (2017) in Germany) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event produced by WWE for the SmackDown brand. It took place on February 12, 2017, at the Talking Stick Resort Arena in Phoenix, Arizona. This was the seventh event under the Elimination Chamber chronology, the first to be held since 2015, and this was also the first pay-per-view to feature three women's matches on the main card.
Eight matches were contested at the event, including one on the pre-show. In the main event, Bray Wyatt won the titular Elimination Chamber match to become the new WWE Champion, the first singles championship of his career. On the undercard, Naomi defeated Alexa Bliss to become the new SmackDown Women's Champion, marking her first championship in WWE, Randy Orton defeated Luke Harper, American Alpha retained the SmackDown Tag Team Championship in a tag team turmoil match, and Becky Lynch defeated Mickie James.
