The 2017 NHL Winter Classic (officially the 2017 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic) was an outdoor regular season National Hockey League (NHL) game, part of the Winter Classic series, played on January 2, 2017. The game featured the St. Louis Blues taking on the Chicago Blackhawks at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, Missouri, home of Major League Baseball's Cardinals. The game was announced on March 9, 2016, after news of the matchup had been leaked on February 7 before the details had been finalized, and was one of four outdoor regular season games during the 2016–17 NHL season.
At the opening ceremony, in a break with Winter Classic tradition, only the flag of the United States–and not Canada–was carried in by a color guard, and only a giant Stars & Stripes–not a Maple Leaf flag–was displayed on the field. The only national anthem sung was the Star Spangled Banner, and not O Canada, marking the first time in the game's history that both anthems were not sung, and the flags of both nations were not displayed.
