On 21 August 2015, a man opened fire on a Thalys train on its way from Amsterdam to Paris before his assault rifle jammed, and he was subdued by passengers. Four people were injured, including the assailant. French police believe the incident to be an Islamist terrorist attack, although the attorney for the accused said that robbery was his only intent. French, American, and British passengers confronted the attacker; they received France's highest decoration, the Legion of Honour, and some received other honours, as well.
