Brock Alan Osweiler (born November 22, 1990) is an American football quarterback for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL). Osweiler played college football at Arizona State University and was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the second round of the 2012 NFL Draft.
During his fourth year with the Broncos, Osweiler was a member of the team that won Super Bowl 50 over the Carolina Panthers. That season marked his first appearance as a starter when he relieved an injured Peyton Manning, whom he had served as a backup to in his first three years, although Manning would resume his starting duties during the postseason. After the Broncos' title victory, Osweiler signed a four-year free agent deal with the Houston Texans in 2016, but was traded to the Cleveland Browns just one season later; he was released prior to the 2017 season and re-signed by the Broncos.
