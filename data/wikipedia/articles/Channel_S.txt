Channel S (Sylheti-ꠌꠦꠘꠦꠟ ꠄꠍ) is a UK-based, free-to-air television channel targeting the British Bangladeshi community. The channel was established on 16 December 2004, by Mahee Ferdous Jalill – a Bangladeshi businessman in London. On Sky it had a timesharing deal with ATN Global, and then in 2005 it started to broadcast for 24 hours, 7 days a week, and is currently available on Sky channel 814. As well as that, their shows such as 'Channel S News' tend to copy sounds from other companies such as the BBC. The channel claims to be the "Voice of British Bangladeshis across the world", and its slogan "Working for the community", broadcasting mainly in Bengali and occasionally in Sylheti, and programmes suiting the community needs.
The television station is based at Prestige House in Walthamstow, North East London. It broadcasts programmes in Bengali, Sylheti and a few in English. It is the first Bangladeshi channel to broadcast content in the Sylheti dialect, it has built up a loyal following among the Bangladeshis in the United Kingdom who the majority come from Sylhet. Since the launch of the channel in 2004, there has been bitter rivalry between Channel S and Bangla TV, with Channel S gaining rights to broadcast the Baishakhi Mela. A survey in the UK found Channel S was the most viewed Bengali TV channel in the UK.
