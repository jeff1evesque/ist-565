In 2017, Riana joined the second season of Asia's Got Talent where she was declared the winner after beating the Filipino hip-hop dance group DM-X Comvale√±oz based on the audience votes in the grand final. Videos of her magic performances onstage have garnered over 70 million views on Facebook and YouTube. In 2018, she appeared on season 13 of America's Got Talent where she was eliminated in the quarterfinals.
