In public-key cryptography, a public key fingerprint is a short sequence of bytes used to identify a longer public key.  Fingerprints are created by applying a cryptographic hash function to a public key.  Since fingerprints are shorter than the keys they refer to, they can be used to simplify certain key management tasks. In Microsoft software, "thumbprint" is used instead of "fingerprint".
