Stephen Gordon Hendry  (born 13 January 1969) is a Scottish former professional snooker player and current commentator for the BBC and ITV. He is best known for his domination of the sport in the 1990s, during which he won the World Championship seven times, a record in the modern era, and was ranked world number one for eight consecutive seasons between 1990 and 1998, and again in 2007. The all-time record holder for the number of ranking titles won (36), Hendry is widely regarded as one of the greatest snooker players ever.
As well as his seven World Championship titles, five of which he won consecutively, Hendry also won six Masters (including five consecutively) and five UK Championship titles. His 18 Triple Crown tournament wins is the joint-highest of all time, equalled only by Ronnie O'Sullivan. One of only three players to have won all three Triple Crown events in a single season, Hendry is also the only player to achieve this feat twice, in the 1989/1990 and 1995/1996 seasons. A prolific break builder, Hendry recorded the second-most competitive century breaks (775), and holds the records for the most century breaks compiled in one match (7), the most centuries compiled in one tournament (16), as well as making 11 competitive maximum breaks, second only to O'Sullivan with 14.Hendry became the youngest professional snooker player in 1985 aged 16 and, in 1990, he was the youngest-ever world champion, at the age of 21. He was awarded an MBE in 1994, and voted BBC Scotland's Sports Personality of the Year in 1987 and 1996. In May 2012, after featuring in his 27th consecutive World Championship, he announced his retirement from the game, bringing an end to his record of 23 consecutive seasons in the top 16 of the world rankings.
