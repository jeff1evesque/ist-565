That season, he also won the Walter Payton Award as the best offensive player in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).Garoppolo saw light duty behind Brady in his seasons in New England. In October 2017, Garoppolo was traded by the Patriots to the 49ers. He won his first five starts with his new team as quarterback, which, including his two victorious starts for New England, earned him a 7â€“0 record as a starter, a feat last accomplished by Ben Roethlisberger in 2004. Garoppolo signed a lucrative, record-breaking five-year contract with the 49ers in February 2018.
