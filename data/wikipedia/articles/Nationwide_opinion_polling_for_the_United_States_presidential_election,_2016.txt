This page lists nationwide public opinion polls that have been conducted relating to the 2016 United States presidential election. The two major party candidates were chosen at the Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention in July 2016.
Donald Trump won the general election of Tuesday, November 8, 2016 despite being behind in nearly all opinion polls. Media analysts differ as to why the polling industry was unable to correctly forecast the result.  Two daily tracking polls, the UPI/CVoter poll and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll were the only polls that often predicted a Trump popular vote victory or showed a nearly tied election.  Trump ultimately lost the popular vote while winning the electoral college.
