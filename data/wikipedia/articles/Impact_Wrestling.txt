Impact Wrestling is an American professional wrestling promotion currently based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The promotion operates as a subsidiary of Anthem Sports & Entertainment via its parent company, Anthem Wrestling Exhibitions, LLC.Founded by Jeff and Jerry Jarrett in 2002, in Nashville, Tennessee, the promotion was initially known as NWA: Total Nonstop Action (NWA-TNA) and was associated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). It withdrew from the NWA in 2004 and became known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), but it continued to use the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team championships as part of an agreement. After the agreement ended in 2007, the company created its own TNA World Heavyweight and TNA World Tag Team championships. The promotion was purchased by Anthem at the beginning of 2017, and it was renamed Impact Wrestling after its main television series.
Impact Wrestling (under its former name, TNA) had been considered the second largest professional wrestling promotion in the United States behind WWE up to at least 2015. However, from mid-2017, Impact has become increasingly viewed to have fallen behind longtime rival Ring of Honor. The loss of their former television contract and personnel issues have been noted as contributing factors to their decline.
