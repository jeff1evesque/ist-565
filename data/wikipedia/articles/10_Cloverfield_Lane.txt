10 Cloverfield Lane is a 2016 American science fiction psychological horror film directed by Dan Trachtenberg, produced by J. J. Abrams and Lindsey Weber and written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. The film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. It is the second installment in the Cloverfield franchise. The film was developed from a script titled The Cellar, but under production by Bad Robot, it was turned into a spiritual successor to the 2008 film Cloverfield. The film follows a young woman who, after a car crash, wakes up in an underground bunker with two men who insist that an event has left the surface of Earth uninhabitable.
The film is presented in a third-person narrative, in contrast to its predecessor's found-footage style. It was released in the United States on March 11, 2016, in conventional and IMAX format. The film received positive reviews, with many praising the performances of the cast, as well as the film's tense and suspenseful atmosphere; it grossed $110 million worldwide.
