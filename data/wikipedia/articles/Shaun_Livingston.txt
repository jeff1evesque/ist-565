Shaun Patrick Livingston (born September 11, 1985) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Livingston entered the league directly out of high school after he was selected in the first round of the 2004 NBA draft by the Los Angeles Clippers with the 4th overall pick. In 2007, Livingston suffered a debilitating knee injury that damaged almost every part of his left knee, and it took him about a year and a half to return to action. Livingston later played for the Miami Heat, Oklahoma City Thunder, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Bobcats, Milwaukee Bucks, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Brooklyn Nets. He has also spent time with the Tulsa 66ers of the NBA Development League. He is a three-time NBA champion, winning all three with Golden State in 2015, 2017, and 2018.
