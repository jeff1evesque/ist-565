Foodfight! is a 2012 American computer animated adventure comedy film produced by Threshold Entertainment and directed by Lawrence Kasanoff. The film features the voices of Charlie Sheen, Wayne Brady, Hilary Duff, Eva Longoria, Larry Miller, and Christopher Lloyd. It tells the story of brand mascots ("ikes") who come to life in a supermarket after closing time, and their struggles against the villainous forces of Brand X.
Despite Kasanoff raising tens of millions in funding, Foodfight! had a troubled and much delayed production. The film was originally scheduled for a Christmas 2003 theatrical release, however this failed to materialize, and later planned release dates were also missed. Eventually, after the producers defaulted on a loan, in September 2011 creditors auctioned off the film's assets and all associated rights. In 2012, the film had a low-key release, being direct-to-video in most territories.
