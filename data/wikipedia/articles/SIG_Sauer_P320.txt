The SIG Sauer P320 is a modular design of semi-automatic pistol made by Sig Sauer, Inc. of Exeter, New Hampshire and SIG Sauer GmbH of Eckernförde, Germany. The SIG Sauer P320 can be chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum (referred to in the U.S. as 9mm Luger), .357 SIG, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The handguns made in 9mm, .357 SIG, and .40 S&W calibers can be easily converted from one to another.  A change from .357 Sig to .40 S&W requires only a barrel change.  The change between 9mm to .357 Sig or .40 S&W and vice versa are accomplished using a caliber exchange kit.
The P320 chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum was introduced in the North American market on 15 January 2014 followed by the .45 ACP compact model at the SHOT Show in January 2015. The P320 is a further development of the SIG Sauer P250 utilizing a striker-fired mechanism in lieu of a double action only hammer system. On 19 January 2017, it was announced that a customized version of the SIG Sauer P320 had won the United States Army's XM17 Modular Handgun System competition.  The full-sized model will be known as the M17 and the carry sized model will be known as the M18.
