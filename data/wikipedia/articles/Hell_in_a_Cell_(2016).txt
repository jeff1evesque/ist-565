Hell in a Cell (2016) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event produced by WWE for the Raw brand. It took place on October 30, 2016 at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. It was the eighth event under the Hell in a Cell chronology.
Eight matches were contested at the event, including one on the pre-show. For the first-time ever for a WWE pay-per-view, a women's match was the main event, which was also the first-ever women's Hell in a Cell match that saw Charlotte defeat Sasha Banks to capture her third Raw Women's Championship. WWE promoted two other matches as main event matches, which were also Hell in a Cell matches: Kevin Owens defeated Seth Rollins to retain the WWE Universal Championship and Roman Reigns retained the United States Championship against Rusev.
