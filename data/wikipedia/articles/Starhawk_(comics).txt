Starhawk (Stakar of the House of Ogord) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by Steve Gerber (writer) and Sal Buscema (artist). He is an antihero in the Earth-691 timeline of the Marvel Comics universe.
Stakar was fated to eventually re-inhabit his infant body, reliving his life over countless times. Because of the knowledge of things to come, he manipulated events to affect what he felt would be the best outcome, referring to himself as "One Who Knows". He made many enemies in doing so, but his tampering and guidance also led to the formation of the Guardians of the Galaxy in the 31st Century.Upon receiving his power from the Hawk God, Starhawk identified himself and summarized his purpose by saying "I am the wisdom and the glory of your ancestors. I am the light and the giver of light. I am your heritage and your destiny! I am the POWER that was Arcturus!"Sylvester Stallone plays Stakar in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with his first appearance being in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.
