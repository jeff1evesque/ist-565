Marvin Ronald Lewis (born September 23, 1958) is the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL), a position he has held since January 14, 2003. Previously, he was the defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens from 1996 to 2001, whose record-setting defense in 2000 helped them win Super Bowl XXXV 34–7 over the New York Giants.
Taking over after a franchise worst 2–14 record in 2002, Lewis led the Bengals in back to back 8–8 finishes in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, his team captured their first winning season and first AFC North division title in fifteen years. He is the first Bengals coach since team founder Paul Brown in 1970 to be named coach of the year by the Associated Press, an award he won in 2009 following a 10–6 regular season and another division title. Lewis has guided the Bengals to five straight playoff appearances from 2011 to 2015 and an 8–0 start in 2015, both firsts in franchise history, and holds the record for most wins as a Bengals head coach. Despite this success, Lewis has been unable to lead the Bengals to a postseason win. His seven postseason losses are the most of any coach who has never won a playoff game, and his 15 years as an NFL head coach are tied with Jim E. Mora for most seasons coached without a playoff win.
