Bara'a Night (Arabic: ليلة البراءة‎, translit. Laylat al-Bara’at) or Mid-Sha'ban (Arabic: نصف شعبان‎, translit. Niṣf Sha‘bān) is a holiday observed by various Muslim communities on the night between 14 and 15 Sha'ban. It is regarded as a night when the fortunes of men for the coming year are decided and when God may forgive sinners. In many regions, this is also a night when prayers are arranged for forgiveness from God for one's deceased ancestors. Additionally, Twelver Shia Muslims commemorate the birthday of Muhammad al-Mahdi on this date. Salafi streams oppose the recognition of Mid-Sha'ban as exceptional.
