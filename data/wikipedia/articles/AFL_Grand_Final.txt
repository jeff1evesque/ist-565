The AFL Grand Final is an annual Australian rules football match, traditionally held on the final Saturday in September or the first Saturday in October at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Australia, to determine the Australian Football League (AFL) premiers for that year. The game has become significant to Australian culture, spawning a number of traditions and surrounding activities which have grown in popularity since the interstate expansion of the Victorian Football League in the 1980s and the subsequent creation of the national AFL competition in the 1990s. The 2006 Sweeney Sports Report concluded that the AFL Grand Final has become Australia's most important sporting event, with the largest attendance, metropolitan television audience and overall interest of any annual Australian sporting event.
The winning club of the grand final receives the AFL's premiership cup and the premiership flag. All players in the winning team receive a gold premiership medallion.
Every club has played in the grand final, with the exception of the two recent expansion clubs, Gold Coast and Greater Western Sydney, and two former clubs, the short-lived University and Brisbane Bears.
