The O. J. Simpson robbery case (officially State of Nevada v. Orenthal James Simpson, et al.) was a criminal case prosecuted in 2007–2008 in the U.S. state of Nevada, primarily involving the retired American football player O. J. Simpson.
On the night of September 13, 2007, a group of men led by Simpson entered a room in the Palace Station hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia dealer, testified that the group of men broke into his hotel room and stole various sports memorabilia at gunpoint.  Three days later, on September 16, 2007, Simpson was arrested for his involvement in the robbery and held without bail.  He admitted taking the items, which he said had been stolen from him, but denied breaking into the room.  Simpson also denied the allegation that he or the people with him carried weapons.On October 3, 2008—exactly 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown, and Ronald Goldman—Simpson was found guilty of all 10 charges. On December 5, 2008, Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison with eligibility for parole in nine years (in October 2017). On July 20, 2017, Simpson was granted parole, and was freed on October 1, 2017.
