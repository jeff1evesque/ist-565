Tyronn Jamar Lue (, born May 3, 1977) is an American professional basketball coach and former player. He is the current head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
The 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m), 175 lb (79 kg) point guard was selected out of the University of Nebraska by the Denver Nuggets with the 23rd overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft and was traded shortly thereafter to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he won two NBA Championships in his first three seasons.
After his playing career ended in 2009, Lue became Director of Basketball Development for the Boston Celtics. In 2014, he was hired by the Cavaliers as associate head coach and was promoted to head coach midseason in 2015â€“16, replacing the fired David Blatt. That same season, Lue led the Cavaliers to their first NBA championship and became one of the few rookie coaches in the NBA to ever lead his team to a title.
