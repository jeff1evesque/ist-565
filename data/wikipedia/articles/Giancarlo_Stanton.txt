Giancarlo Cruz Michael Stanton (born November 8, 1989) is an American professional baseball outfielder and designated hitter for the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his major league debut on June 8, 2010, as a member of the Miami Marlins, where he played through 2017. Known for his prodigious physical strength and ability to regularly hit long home runs, Stanton has twice led the National League (NL) in home runs, including hitting 59 in 2017, the most in 16 years. Before 2012, he was known as Mike Stanton.  A right-handed batter and thrower, Stanton stands 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m) tall and weighs 245 pounds (111 kg).
From the Greater Los Angeles region, Stanton graduated from Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks before the Marlins selected him in the second round of the 2007 MLB draft.  The 2017 NL Most Valuable Player (MVP), Stanton also led the league in runs batted in (RBI) and slugging percentage.  A four-time MLB All-Star, Stanton has twice won both the NL Hank Aaron and outfield Silver Slugger Awards, both times after leading the league in home runs. In November 2014, the Marlins signed Stanton to the richest total dollar value contract in team sports history, worth $325 million over 13 years. After the 2017 season, the team traded him to the Yankees.
