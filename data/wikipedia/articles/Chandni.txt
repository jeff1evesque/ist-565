The film stars Sridevi in the titular role. Rishi Kapoor, Vinod Khanna and Waheeda Rehman are featured in supporting roles.

She faces a dilemma when her fiancé returns to her life.
The eighties marked a professional setback in Chopra's career, as several films he directed and produced in that period were critical and commercial failures. After a series of failed action movies, Chopra decided to return to his roots and make a romantic musical, a film with all the hallmarks of what has come to be known as the "Yash Chopra style": heroine-oriented, romantic, emotional, depicting the lifestyle of the super elite, with melodic music used in songs picturised in foreign locations. The film marked the first collaboration between Chopra and Sridevi. Upon release, Chandni received widespread critical acclaim and was a major commercial success, grossing ₹80.5 million, becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of 1989. The huge success of the film and its soundtrack were instrumental in ending the era of violent action films in Indian Cinema and rejuvenating the romantic musical genre. The success of Chandni consolidated Sridevi's position as the top female star of the era. Over the years, Chandni is hailed as one of the greatest Indian films of all time and one of Chopra's finest movies.At the 37th National Film Awards, the film received the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. At the 35th Filmfare Awards, Chandni received 10 nominations including Best Film and winning Best Cinematography.
