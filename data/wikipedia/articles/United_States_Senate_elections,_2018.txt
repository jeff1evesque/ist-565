Elections to the United States Senate will be held November 6, 2018, with 33 of the 100 seats in the Senate being contested in regular elections and two seats being contested in special elections. The winners will serve six-year terms from January 3, 2019, to January 3, 2025. Currently, Democrats have 24 seats up for election, including the seats of two independents who caucus with them. Republicans have nine seats up for election. The seats up for regular election in 2018 were last up for election in 2012; in addition, special elections will be scheduled if vacancies occur, as has already happened in Minnesota and Mississippi. After the 2016 elections, some state election officials are trying to upgrade voting systems in time for this election.Other elections that will be held on this date include the elections to the U.S. House of Representatives, 39 Governorships as well as various other state and local elections.
Republicans can only afford to have a net loss of one Senate seat and still have a working majority with the Vice President breaking the tie in their favor. Three of the Republican seats are open as a result of retirements in Tennessee, Utah, and Arizona. Democrats are defending ten seats in states won by Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, while Republicans are only defending one seat in a state won by Hillary Clinton in 2016.
