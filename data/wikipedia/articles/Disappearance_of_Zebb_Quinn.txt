Zebb Wayne Quinn (May 12, 1981 â€“ disappeared January 2, 2000) is an American teenager who went missing in Asheville, North Carolina. Quinn was 18 years old and working at a local Walmart when he disappeared after finishing his shift. His car was discovered several days later in a restaurant parking lot under unusual circumstances: its headlights had been left on, a live puppy had been left inside, and a drawing of a pair of lips and an exclamation mark had been scrawled in pink lipstick on the back window.
Seventeen years later, on July 10, 2017, Robert Jason Owens was indicted on charges of murdering Quinn. Owens worked with Quinn at Walmart and was the last known person to have seen Quinn alive.
