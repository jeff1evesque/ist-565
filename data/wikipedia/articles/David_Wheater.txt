David James Wheater (born 14 February 1987) is an English professional footballer who captains Bolton Wanderers as a defender. He is a centre back, although he is capable of playing at right back as well.
Wheater started his professional career at Middlesbrough in 2004, having graduated through the club's youth teams. He had three loan spells away from Middlesbrough during the 2006â€“07 season; at Doncaster Rovers, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Darlington (loan). An injury to Jonathan Woodgate at the start of the following season saw Wheater become a regular player for Middlesbrough, and he would make a total of 140 league appearances for the club before switching to current club Bolton Wanderers in January 2011.
Wheater has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels, but is yet to make his senior debut for his country.
