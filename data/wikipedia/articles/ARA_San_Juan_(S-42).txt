ARA San Juan (S-42) was a TR-1700-class diesel-electric submarine in service with the Argentine Navy as part of the Argentine Submarine Force between 1986 and 2017. The submarine was built in West Germany and entered service on 19 November 1985. San Juan underwent a mid-life update from 2008 to 2013.
On 15 November 2017, San Juan stopped communicating during a routine patrol in the South Atlantic off the coast of Argentina. A multi-nation search operation was mounted to try to locate the submarine, which was believed to have suffered an electrical malfunction.  Within hours of San Juan's last transmission, reports describe an acoustic anomaly consistent with an explosion, detected in the vicinity of the vessel's last known location. On 30 November, hopes of rescuing the crew alive were abandoned.
