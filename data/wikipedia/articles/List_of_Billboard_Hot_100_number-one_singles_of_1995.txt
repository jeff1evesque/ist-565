The Billboard Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by Billboard magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical sales and airplays.
Twelve singles topped the chart during the year. "On Bended Knee" by Boyz II Men began its peak at the top in 1994. The longest running number-one single of 1995 is "Fantasy" by Mariah Carey, which logged eight weeks atop the chart. The second longest-reigning number one single is a three-way tie between "Take a Bow" by Madonna, "This Is How We Do It" by Montell Jordan, and "Waterfalls" by TLC, with seven weeks each.
"One Sweet Day" by Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men holds the record for the longest running song at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 with 16 weeks and continues to hold it (along with "Despacito" by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee, which also spent 16 weeks at number-one in 2017). It also broke the 14-week record held by Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You" and Boyz II Men's "I'll Make Love to You". Five of those weeks were logged in 1995 and the other 11 weeks were logged in 1996. Michael Jackson's "You Are Not Alone" became the first single to debut at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 and holds the Guinness World Record as the first song in the 37-year history of the Billboard Hot 100 to debut at number one. In addition, "Fantasy", "Exhale (Shoop Shoop)" by Whitney Houston, and "One Sweet Day" also debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100.
