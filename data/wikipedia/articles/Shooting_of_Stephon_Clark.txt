Stephon Clark (legal name Stephan Alonzo Clark) was shot and killed on the evening of March 18, 2018, by two officers of the Sacramento Police Department in Sacramento, California, United States. The officers were looking for a suspect who was breaking windows in the Meadowview neighborhood, and confronted Clark, an unarmed 22-year-old Black American man whom they found in the yard of his grandmother's house, where he resided. Clark ran from the police in an encounter that was filmed by police video cameras. A Sacramento County Sheriff's Department helicopter was involved in observing an individual on the ground and in directing ground officers to the point at which the shooting took place. Helicopter video footage was released 3 days after the shooting. The officers stated that they shot Clark, firing 20 rounds, believing that he had pointed a gun at them. After the shooting, police reported that he was carrying only a cell phone. According to an independent autopsy, Clark was shot eight times including six times in the back. However, the Sacramento County Coroner's autopsy report concluded that Clark was shot seven times including three shots to the right side of the back. 
The shooting caused large protests in Sacramento, and Clark's family members have rejected the initial police description of the events leading to Clark's death. The Sacramento Police Department placed the officers on paid administrative leave and opened a use of force investigation. Police have stated they are confident that Clark was the suspect responsible for breaking windows in the area prior to the encounter.
