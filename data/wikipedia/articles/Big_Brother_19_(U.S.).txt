Big Brother 19 is the nineteenth season of the American reality television series Big Brother. It is based upon the Dutch series of the same name. The season premiered on June 28, 2017 on CBS in the United States with a two-hour season premiere and Julie Chen returning as host. The season was titled "Summer of Temptation" with the various contestants able to receive a temptation which gave the taker a surprise reward or game advantage but also unleashed a game change for one or more other players. Viewers at home were able to vote to offer selected chosen players a secret temptation.  A weekly opt-in competition, known as the Temptation Challenge, would give the winner immunity from the week's nomination but also put the last-place finisher on the block as a third nominee, able to compete in the weekly Veto Competition and avoid a backdoor nomination.
On September 20, 2017, Josh Martinez won the game in a 5â€“4 vote against returning Big Brother 18 runner-up Paul Abrahamian, earning the latter the distinction of being the first person to lose a Final 2 jury vote twice.
