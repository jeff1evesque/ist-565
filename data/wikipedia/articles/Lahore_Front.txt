The Battle of Lahore (Urdu: لاہور کی لڑائی‬, Hindi: लाहौर की लड़ाई Lāhaur kī laḍ.āī) or the Lahore Front were a series of battles in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 fought in around Lahore. The battle ended with an Indian tactical victory. However Indian forces halted their assault on Lahore once they had reached captured the village of Burki. The rationale for this was that a ceasefire was to be signed soon, and had India captured Lahore it would likely have been returned in ceasefire negotiations.
