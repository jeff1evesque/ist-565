Mount Agung, a volcano on the island of Bali in Indonesia, erupted five times in late November 2017, causing thousands to evacuate, disrupting air travel and causing environmental damage. As of  27 November 2017, the alert level was at its highest and evacuation orders were in place.
Tectonic earthquakes from the volcano had been detected since early August, and volcanic activity intensified for several weeks before decreasing significantly in late October. A second, more violent period of major activity began in late November.
