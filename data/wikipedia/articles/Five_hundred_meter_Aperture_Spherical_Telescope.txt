The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST; Chinese: 五百米口径球面射电望远镜), nicknamed Tianyan (天眼, lit. "Heavenly Eye" or "The Eye of Heaven") is a radio telescope located in the Dawodang depression (大窝凼洼地), a natural basin in Pingtang County, Guizhou Province, southwest China.  It consists of a fixed 500 m (1,600 ft) diameter dish constructed in a natural depression in the landscape. It is the world's largest filled-aperture radio telescope, and the second-largest single-dish aperture after the sparsely-filled RATAN-600 in Russia.It has a novel design, using an active surface made of metal panels that can be tilted by a computer to help change the focus to different areas of the sky. The cabin containing the feed antenna suspended on cables above the dish is also moved using a digitally-controlled winch by the computer control system to steer the instrument to receive from different directions.
Construction on the FAST project began in 2011 and it achieved first light in September 2016.  It is currently undergoing testing and commissioning. It observes at wavelengths of 10 cm to 4.3 m.The telescope made its first discovery of two new pulsars in August 2017, barely 1 year after its first light. The new pulsars PSR J1859-01 and PSR J1931-02, which are also referred to as FAST pulsar #1 and #2 (FP1 and FP2), were detected on 22 and 25 August and are 16,000 and 4,100 light years away, respectively. They were independently confirmed by the Parkes Observatory in Australia on 10 September. The telescope had detected dozens more pulsar candidates in space, and six other discoveries have been confirmed by other international organizations, taking its discovery total to nine by October 2017.
