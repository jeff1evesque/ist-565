Monster is a 2003 biographical crime drama film written and directed by Patty Jenkins. The film is about serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a former prostitute who was executed in Florida in 2002 for killing six men (she was not tried for a seventh murder) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Wuornos was played by Charlize Theron; her semi-fictionalized lover, Selby Wall (based on Wuornos's real-life girlfriend Tyria Moore), was played by Christina Ricci.
Theron received critical acclaim and won numerous  awards for her portrayal, including the Academy Award for Best Actress, Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and the Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress. Monster was produced by Denver & Delilah Films and K/W Productions and distributed by Newmarket Films.
