Money in the Bank (2018) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event, produced by WWE for their Raw and SmackDown brands. It took place on June 17, 2018, at the Allstate Arena in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont, Illinois. It was the ninth event under the Money in the Bank chronology.
The card comprised eleven matches, including one match on the pre-show. In the main event, Braun Strowman won the titular ladder match on the men's side, while Alexa Bliss won the women's ladder match. Bliss cashed in her contract later in the night to win the Raw Women's Championship from Nia Jax after causing a disqualification in the previous title match between Ronda Rousey and Jax. On the undercard, AJ Styles retained the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura in a Last Man Standing match, and Carmella retained the SmackDown Women's Championship against Asuka with help from the returning James Ellsworth.
