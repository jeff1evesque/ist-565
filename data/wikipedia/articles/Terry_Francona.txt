Terrence Jon Francona (born April 22, 1959), nicknamed "Tito", is the manager of the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB). Previously, he was the manager of the Boston Red Sox, whom he led to two World Series titles, ending the franchise's 86-year championship drought.
After an unsuccessful four-year stint as the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies, Francona was hired to manage the Red Sox in 2004 and led the team to their first championship since 1918. He won another World Series with Boston in 2007 and continued to manage the team until the end of the 2011 season, where his contract wasn't renewed following a September collapse. In 2013, Francona was hired to manage the Cleveland Indians and led them to an American League pennant in 2016. In August and September 2017, he led the Indians to a 22-game win streak, the longest win streak in American League history and the longest without ties in MLB history.
