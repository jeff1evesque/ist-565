Dustin Martin (born 26 June 1991) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for the Richmond Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). Martin grew up in Castlemaine, Victoria, and as a junior played for the Castlemaine Football Club and the Bendigo Pioneers. He was drafted by Richmond with the third pick in the 2009 national draft, and made his debut for the club in round one of the 2010 season. He was nominated for the 2010 AFL Rising Star award, but was ineligible to win due to suspension.
Martin has been a fixture in Richmond's line-up since his debut. After becoming a household name in his first few seasons, Martin won the Jack Dyer Medal as Richmond's best and fairest player in 2016, along with his first All-Australian selection. 
In 2017, Martin had what was described by AFL legend Leigh Matthews as the greatest ever individual season, despite constant media speculation over his playing future: he won the league's highest individual honour, the Brownlow Medal, with a record 36 votes, and also won the Leigh Matthews Trophy, the AFL Coaches Association's Champion Player of the Year, his second All-Australian selection, a premiership and the Norm Smith Medal as the best afield in the 2017 AFL Grand Final, among other accolades. By achieving this feat, Martin became the first player to win a Brownlow Medal, premiership and Norm Smith Medal in a single season. He then capped off his season by winning the Gary Ayres Award as the best player in that year's finals series, along with his second Jack Dyer Medal.
