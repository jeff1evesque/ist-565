R. H. Bing (October 20, 1914 in Oakwood, Texas â€“ April 28, 1986 in Austin, Texas) was an American mathematician who worked mainly in the areas of geometric topology and continuum theory.   His father was named Rupert Henry, but Bing's mother  thought that "Rupert Henry" was too British for Texas.  She compromised by abbreviating it to R. H. (Singh 1986) Consequently, R. H. does not stand for a first or middle name.
