He is most recognized for being part of the Dream Team that successfully defended O. J. Simpson in 1995, from the charges that he murdered his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, in 1994. Shortly after the O. J. Simpson murder case, he steered his practice away from criminal defense toward civil litigation. He also cofounded LegalZoom and RightCounsel.com and appears in their television commercials.
