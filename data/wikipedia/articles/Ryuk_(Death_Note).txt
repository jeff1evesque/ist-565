Ryuk (Japanese: リューク, Hepburn: Ryūku) is a fictional character in the manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is a bored Shinigami (a Japanese god of death) that drops a Death Note, a notebook that allows the user to kill anyone simply by knowing their name and face, into the human world in order to have relief from his boredom. The Death Note ends up in the city of Tokyo, where it is picked up by Light Yagami, an intellectually-gifted high school student who uses it in an attempt to create and rule a utopia cleansed of evil, with him at the helm as a "god".
In the anime adaptation, Ryuk is voiced by Nakamura Shidō in Japanese and by Brian Drummond in the English version. Both actors reprise their roles for voicing the computer-generated version of the character in the live-action films, with Jun Fukushima voicing the CG version in the live-action television drama. In the musical, Ryuk was portrayed by Kōtarō Yoshida. Willem Dafoe provided the voice acting and facial motion capture in the American live-action film adaptation.
