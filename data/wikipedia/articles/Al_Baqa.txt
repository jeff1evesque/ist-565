Al Baqa or Al Baqa'a, also spelled Al-Beqa or Al baqr, (meaning "The open valley") is a Palestinian village located just east of Hebron. It is occupied by Israel since 1967, together with the rest of the West Bank. It is sandwiched between the Israeli settlements Givat Harsina and Kiryat Arba. Wadi al-Ghrous or Wadi al Gruz is a locality of Hebron that borders Al Baqa on the west.
A Bedouin village with the name Al Baqa'a also exists some 11 kilometers southeast from Ramallah.
