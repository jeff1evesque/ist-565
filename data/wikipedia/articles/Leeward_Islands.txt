The Leeward Islands  are a group of islands situated where the northeastern Caribbean Sea meets the western Atlantic Ocean. On a map, they start with the Virgin Islands east of Puerto Rico and reach southeast to Dominica. In English, the term Leeward Islands refers to the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles chain. The more southerly part of this chain, starting with Martinique, is called the Windward Islands.
