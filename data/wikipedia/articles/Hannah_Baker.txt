Hannah Baker is a fictional character created by American author Jay Asher. She is the subject of his 2007 young adult fiction mystery novel Thirteen Reasons Why, which was adapted by the media company Netflix as 13 Reasons Why. Hannah is introduced as a sophomore at the fictional Liberty High School; she struggles to adjust to living in an unsympathetic school environment. In the television series, Hannah is portrayed by Australian actress Katherine Langford, who returned for the show's second season, which was released in 2018.13 Reasons Why received largely positive, though also polarizing, reviews from critics and audiences. Although critics were divided on several aspects of the show, in particular how it handled mental health and its depictions of rape and suicide, they praised Langford's performance. Langford later received a Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance. She was catapulted to worldwide attention and was variously called "a revelation", "believable and raw", and "magnetic". Daniel Montgomery of the Gold Derby said she was an early frontrunner for an Emmy Award nomination.
