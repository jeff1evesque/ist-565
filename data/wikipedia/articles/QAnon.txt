QAnon () is a conspiracy theory which began with an October 2017 post on the anonymous, unmoderated imageboard 4chan by someone using the handle Q, a presumably American individual that may have later grown to include multiple individuals claiming to have access to classified information involving the Trump administration and its opponents in the United States. The theory details a supposed secret conspiracy by a "deep state" against President Trump and his supporters. The account has falsely accused numerous Hollywood actors, politicians, and other high-ranking officials of engaging in an international child sex trafficking ring. Q is a reference to top-secret Q clearance.
The conspiracy theory, mainly popularized by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump under the names The Storm and The Great Awakening, has been widely characterized as "baseless," "unhinged," and "evidence-free." Its proponents have been called "a deranged conspiracy cult."QAnon believers began appearing at Trump rallies during the summer of 2018 and a major QAnon promoter was granted a photo op with President Trump in the Oval Office on August 24, 2018.
