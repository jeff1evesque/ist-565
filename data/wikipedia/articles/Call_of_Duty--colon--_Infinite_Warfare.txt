Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. It is the thirteenth primary installment in the Call of Duty series and was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 4, 2016.
Development of Infinite Warfare began during 2014. It is the first title by Infinity Ward under the new three-year development cycle for the Call of Duty series. The game's campaign is centered around a battle for the Solar System, which the Settlement Defense Front (SDF), a hostile force who are the main antagonists, are attempting to take over. The player takes control of Captain Nick Reyes of the Special Combat Air Recon (SCAR). They have their own transforming fighter, named "Jackal", that they can customize as well as a central hub world named Retribution.
Special editions of Infinite Warfare were released with a remastered version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, entitled Modern Warfare Remastered. Infinite Warfare's announcement trailer was met with a mixed reception from game critics and journalists and a negative reception from the Call of Duty community. The announcement trailer was the second-most disliked video on YouTube at the time, in part due to a campaign by fans of rival game Battlefield 1 and disgruntled Call of Duty fans expressing frustration at the direction the series had taken. Nevertheless, the game received generally positive reviews upon release; critics praised the single-player campaign, which was seen as a considerable improvement over the game's predecessor, Black Ops III, the greater player freedom approach in missions, the Zombies mode, and the visuals, while the multiplayer mode was criticized for its lack of innovation. Infinite Warfare underperformed in sales compared to previous Call of Duty titles.
