Robert Beck (born Robert Lee Maupin or Robert Moppins, Jr.; August 4, 1918 â€“ April 30, 1992), better known as Iceberg Slim, was an American pimp who subsequently became an influential author among a primarily African-American readership. Beck's novels were adapted into movies, and the imagery and tone of Beck's fiction have been acknowledged as an influence by several gangsta rap musicians, including Ice T and Ice Cube, whose names are homages to Beck.
