That year Pederson led the PCL in runs, home runs, walks, on-base percentage, and OPS, while stealing 30 bases. He was named the PCL Most Valuable Player, to both the mid-season and postseason PCL All-Star teams, and was selected as Baseball America's AAA Player of the Year. In 2015, he was named the 8th-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America. 
He began the 2015 season as the Dodgers' starting center fielder, and the third-youngest player in the NL.  Pederson was selected to the NL team in the 2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and was chosen to start in left field.
