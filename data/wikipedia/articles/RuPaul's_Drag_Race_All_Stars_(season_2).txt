The second season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars premiered on the Logo network on a new night; Thursday, August 25, 2016. Returning judges included RuPaul, Michelle Visage, with Carson Kressley joining the panel, while the space previously occupied by Ross Matthews was filled by Todrick Hall. Cast members were announced on June 17, 2016. This season featured ten All-Star contestants, selected from the show's second season through to its seventh season, who competed to be inducted into the "Drag Race Hall of Fame".
A new twist was revealed for this season, changing the format of the show. In previous seasons, the bottom two queens had to "Lip-sync for their Life" to avoid elimination. This season had the top two performing queens of the challenge "Lip-sync for their Legacy," with the winner of the lip-sync earning $10,000 and choosing which one of the bottom queens gets eliminated. The prizes for the winner were a one-year supply of Anastasia Beverly Hills cosmetics and a cash prize of $100,000.
The winner of the second season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars was Alaska, with Detox and Katya being the runners-up.
