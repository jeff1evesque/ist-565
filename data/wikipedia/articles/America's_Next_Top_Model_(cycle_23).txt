The twenty-third cycle of America's Next Top Model premiered on December 12, 2016 on VH1, as a result of the revival of the series following its cancellation by The CW. As opposed to the past three cycles, this cycle followed the series' original format of an all-female contest. 
The cycle was presented by British singer Rita Ora, who took over from former model and businesswoman Tyra Banks. The judging panel was fully revamped, consisting of model Ashley Graham, Paper magazine chief creative officer Drew Elliott, and celebrity stylist Law Roach, replacing the previous panel consisting of Banks, fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone, and runway coach J. Alexander. Banks still served as the series' executive producer.The winner of the competition was 20 year-old India Gants from Seattle, Washington.
