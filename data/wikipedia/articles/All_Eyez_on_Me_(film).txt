All Eyez on Me is a 2017 American biographical drama film about hip-hop artist Tupac Shakur, directed by Benny Boom and written by Jeremy Haft, Eddie Gonzalez and Steven Bagatourian. Titled after Shakur's 1996 fourth studio album, the film stars Demetrius Shipp Jr. as Shakur with Kat Graham, Lauren Cohan, Hill Harper and Danai Gurira in supporting roles.
Talks of a Tupac biopic began in 2011 by Morgan Creek Entertainment Group. The film languished in development hell for several years with various directors, including Antoine Fuqua and John Singleton, attached at different points before Boom was confirmed in November 2015. That December, Shipp Jr., whose father worked on music videos with Shakur, was cast as the singer and principal photography began that month. It lasted until April 2016, filming in Atlanta, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.
All Eyez on Me premiered on June 14, 2017 at the Fox Bruin Theater and was released in the United States on June 16, 2017, on what would have been Shakur's 46th birthday. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but a more positive response from audiences, and grossed $55 million worldwide.
