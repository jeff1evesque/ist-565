Alastair Nathan Cook,  (born 25 December 1984) is an English cricketer who plays for Essex County Cricket Club. A former captain of the England Test and One Day International (ODI) teams, he holds a number of English and international records. He is regarded as one of the greatest batsmen ever to play for England, and is one of the most prolific batsmen of the modern era. 
Cook is England’s most-capped player and has captained the team in an English record 59 Tests and 69 ODIs. He is the leading run-scorer in Test matches for England, and the youngest player to complete 12,000 Test runs (the 6th overall and the only Englishman). Cook has scored a record 32 Test centuries for England and is the first England player to take part in 50 Test victories. A left-handed opening batsman, he normally fields at first slip.
Cook played for Essex's Academy and made his debut for the first XI in 2003. He played in several of England's youth teams from 2000 until his call up to the Test side in 2006. While touring in the West Indies with the ECB National Academy, Cook was called up to the England national team in India as a last-minute replacement for Marcus Trescothick and debuted, aged 21, with a century. He went on to score 1,000 runs in his maiden year and made centuries in his first Test matches against India, Pakistan, the West Indies and Bangladesh. Cook played a pivotal role in England winning the 2009 Ashes series, and, after deputising as Test captain in 2010 and then taking ODI captaincy full-time, in retaining the Ashes in 2010-11. 
He was appointed captain of the Test team after fellow opener Andrew Strauss's retirement on 29 August 2012. Cook captained England to its first Test series victory in India since 1984–85. During the tour he became the first captain to score a century in each of his first five Tests in charge. On 30 May 2015, Cook became the leading run-scorer in Test matches for England, surpassing Graham Gooch (8900). After England's 2016 tour of Bangladesh and India, he stepped down as Test captain. Cook was appointed MBE in 2011 and CBE in 2016 for services to cricket. On 24 May 2018 during the first Test against Pakistan, Cook equalled Allan Border's record for appearing in the most number of consecutive Test matches, with 153, surpassing it a week later in the second Test at Headingley.
