Dera Sacha Sauda ("Camp True-Deal"; colloquially DSS) is an Indian religious group and "non-profit social welfare" organisation (dera) that was established on 29 April 1948 by Mastana Balochistani, an ascetic follower of Baba Sawan Singh (the second Satguru of Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB)), as a centre for religious learning. After Baba Sawan Singh, the movement split into four groups, one of them lead by Mastana Balochistani. After the death of Mastana Balochistani, his movement was split into 3 groups, with Satnam Singh leading the Sirsa group, who selected Gurmeet Ram Rahim to be his successor.  Dera Sacha Sauda's main centre is situated in the city of Sirsa in Haryana state, northern India. The organisation has 46 ashrams (divisions) across India and other countries.Under the leadership of Mastana Balochistani, 25 Ashrams were established in Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, where Naam method of Meditation was taught to the followers who accepted three principles for the rest of their life: No consumption of meat, egg or gelatin, no consumption of alcohol, drugs, tobacco etc. and no adultery or illicit sex. He also laid the foundation of the main ashram in 1948 and coined the expression "Dhan Dhan Satguru Tera Hi Asra" (Blessed are you the true guru, you are my shelter) widely used by the Dera. Shah Satnam Singh Ji lead the Dera from 1963 to 1990. He was succeeded by controversial Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singhin 1990, who added more than dozen ashrams and made Dera much more visible organization.
The current leader, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who himself claims to have more than 60 million followers worldwide, is a controversial figure in India and was accused of murder and convicted of rape. On 25 August 2017, a special CBI court in the city of Panchkula, Haryana, found him guilty of raping two Dera sadhvis (female followers). Subsequently, the special CBI court sentenced Singh for a period of 20-year jail term on 28 August 2017.
