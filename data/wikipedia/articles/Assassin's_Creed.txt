Many spin-off games have been made for Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, iOS, HP webOS, Android, Nokia Symbian and Windows Phone platforms.  The handheld versions are developed by Gameloft and Gryptonite Studios, with additional development by Ubisoft Montreal.
The series has been well received by critics, and has sold over 100 million copies as of  September 2016, becoming Ubisoft's best selling franchise and one of the highest selling video game franchises of all time.
