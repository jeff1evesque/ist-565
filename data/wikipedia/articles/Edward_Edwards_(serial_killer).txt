Edward Wayne Edwards (born Charles Murray, June 14, 1933 â€“ April 7, 2011) was a convicted American serial killer. Edwards escaped from jail in Akron, Ohio in 1955 when he pushed past a guard and fled across the country, holding up gas stations for money. In 1961, he landed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He eventually was captured and arrested in Atlanta, Georgia on January 20, 1962. He was paroled in 1967 and between 1977 and 1996 he murdered at least five people. He is suspected of several additional killings. Several theories have connected Edwards to a variety of crimes including the Zodiac Killer case.
