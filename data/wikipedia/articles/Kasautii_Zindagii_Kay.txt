Kasautii Zindagii Kay (English: The trials of life) is an Indian soap opera created by Ekta Kapoor's Balaji Telefilms for the channel Star Plus. The show ran for seven long years and starred Shweta Tiwari, Cezzane Khan (who was later replaced by Hiten Tejwani), and Ronit Roy in lead roles;  Urvashi Dholakia and Geetanjali Tikekar as the main antagonists. The show explores the story of Anurag and Prerna who fall for each other but they never unite because of Komolika who plots against them and the conspiracies made against them. It describes Anurag and Prerna—lovers who were separated throughout their lives but achieved union in death.
Kasautii Zindagii Kay became the third longest running Indian series after Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii— all three were also produced by Balaji Telefilms. The show recorded one of the highest TRPs and introduced many popular faces like Shweta Tiwari, Cezzane Khan, Urvashi Dholakia, Ronit Roy and Geetanjali Tikekar.A reboot of the show, also named Kasautii Zindagii Kay, is currently being made for the same channel after 18 years with new actors.
