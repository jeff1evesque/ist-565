The ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup is an international cricket tournament organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) contested by national under-19 teams. First contested in 1988, as the Youth World Cup, it was not staged again until 1998. Since then, the World Cup has been held as a biennial event, organised by the ICC. The first edition of the tournament had only eight participants, but every subsequent edition has included sixteen teams. India, the current champions, has won the World Cup four times  which is the highest amongst all teams, while  Australia has won thrice, Pakistan twice  and England, South Africa, and the West Indies once each. Two other teams – New Zealand and Sri Lanka – have made a tournament final without going on to win.
