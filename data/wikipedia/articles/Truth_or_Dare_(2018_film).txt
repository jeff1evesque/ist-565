Jason Blum produced through his Blumhouse Productions banner, and Universal Pictures distributed the film.Released in theaters on April 13, 2018, the film received negative reviews from critics, who said it was "neither inventive nor scary enough to set itself apart from the decades of dreary slashers that came before it". Despite this, the film was a box office success while grossing $94 million worldwide against its $3.5 million production budget.
