A self-performed caesarean section is a form of self-surgery where a woman attempts to perform a caesarean section on herself.
Cases of self-inflicted caesarean section have been reported since the 18th and 19th century. While mostly deadly to either the mother, the child or both, there are at least five known documented successful cases.
