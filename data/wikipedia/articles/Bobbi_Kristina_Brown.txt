Bobbi Kristina Brown (March 4, 1993 â€“ July 26, 2015) was an American reality television and media personality and singer. She was the daughter of singers Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston. Her parents' fame kept Bobbi Kristina in the public eye, including her appearances on the reality show Being Bobby Brown. Brown was 14 when her parents divorced and Houston gained custody. When Houston died in February 2012, Brown was the sole beneficiary of her mother's estate.
That October, Brown caused controversy within both of her parents' families when she announced her engagement to Nick Gordon, a man she previously considered her "big brother". When the couple announced they were married, her father's lawyer released a statement disputing the report.
Brown died from lobar pneumonia on July 26, 2015 after being in a coma for nearly six months.
