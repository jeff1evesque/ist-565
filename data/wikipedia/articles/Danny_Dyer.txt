Daniel John Dyer (born 24 July 1977) is an English actor who has worked in television, film and theatre. Dyer's breakthrough role was as Moff in Human Traffic, with other notable roles as Billy the Limpet in Mean Machine, and as Tommy Johnson in The Football Factory. Following the success of The Football Factory, Dyer was often typecast in "hard-man" roles, although it was this image that allowed him to present The Real Football Factories, its spin-off, The Real Football Factories International and Danny Dyer's Deadliest Men. Dyer has also worked in theatre, having appeared in three plays written by Harold Pinter, with whom he had a close friendship.
In 2013, he was announced as the latest addition to the cast of EastEnders, playing Mick Carter, the most recent landlord of The Queen Victoria. He had previously turned down a role in 2009, and in his autobiography, Straight Up, said that he would not join the cast until he was "fat, bald and fifty". He won the Serial Drama Performance award at the National Television Awards in 2015, and again in 2016.He has also voiced Kent Paul for the Grand Theft Auto gaming franchise, specifically GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas.His screen and stage career, which spans more than two decades, has met with ridicule from critics; Stuart Heritage in The Guardian wrote that Dyer "has become the byword for low-budget, no-quality Brit-trash cinema".
