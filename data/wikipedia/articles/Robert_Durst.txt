Robert Alan Durst (born April 12, 1943) is an American real estate heir, the son of New York City mogul Seymour Durst, and the elder brother of Douglas Durst, head of the Durst Organization. He is suspected of murdering three individuals in different states: Kathleen McCormack Durst, his first wife, who disappeared in New York in 1982; Susan Berman, his longtime friend, who was killed in California in 2000; and his neighbor, Morris Black, who was killed in Texas in 2001. Durst was the subject of a multi-state manhunt and was ultimately convicted of dismembering Black, but acquitted of his murder.
On March 14, 2015, Durst was arrested in New Orleans on a first-degree murder warrant signed by a Los Angeles judge in relation to the Berman killing. On November 4, 2016, he was transferred to California and soon after was arraigned in Los Angeles on first-degree murder charges. A preliminary hearing was initially scheduled for October 2017 but was postponed to April 2018 and is now ongoing.
