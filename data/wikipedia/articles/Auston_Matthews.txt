Auston Matthews (born September 17, 1997) is an American professional ice hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). Previously, Matthews played for the U.S. National U18 Team in the junior United States Hockey League (USHL) ZSC Lions of the Swiss National League. Widely considered the top prospect of the 2016 NHL Entry Draft, Matthews was drafted first overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs. Matthews became the first player in modern NHL history to score four goals in his NHL debut. He scored 40 goals in his first season, the second rookie since the 2004â€“05 lockout to reach the milestone and the fourth teenager in league history to do so, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the top NHL rookie.
Born in San Ramon, California, Matthews and his family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona when he was an infant. He learned to play hockey in Arizona, developing an interest after watching the local Phoenix Coyotes play.
Internationally, Matthews has represented the United States in numerous tournaments including a U17 WHC gold medal, two U18 WJC gold medals, and two IIHF World U20 Championship appearances.
