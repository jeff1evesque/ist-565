Ousmane Dembélé (born 15 May 1997) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club Barcelona and the French national team.
Born in Vernon, Dembélé began his career at Rennes before joining Dortmund in 2016. He won the DFB-Pokal with die Borussen in the 2016–17 season, scoring a goal in the final.  A year later, he transferred to Barcelona for an initial fee of €105 million, becoming at the time the joint-second most expensive footballer ever alongside compatriot Paul Pogba. Dembélé subsequently won the double of La Liga and Copa del Rey in his first season in Spain.
After winning 20 caps and scoring five goals at youth level, Dembélé made his senior international debut for France in 2016. He was chosen in France's squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup which they won.
