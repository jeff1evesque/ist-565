The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) or Bakken pipeline is a 1,172-mile-long (1,886 km) underground oil pipeline in the United States. It begins in the Bakken shale oil fields in northwest North Dakota and continues through South Dakota and Iowa to the oil tank farm near Patoka, Illinois. Together with the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Patoka to Nederland, Texas, it forms the Bakken system.
The $3.78 billion project was announced to the public in June 2014, and informational hearings for landowners took place between August 2014 and January 2015. Dakota Access, LLC, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, L.P., started constructing the pipeline in June 2016. Its minor partners were Phillips 66, Enbridge, and Marathon Petroleum.  The pipeline was completed by April and its first oil was delivered on May 14, 2017.  The pipeline became commercially operational on June 1, 2017.The pipeline has been controversial regarding its impact on the environment. A number of Native Americans in Iowa and the Dakotas have opposed the pipeline, including the Meskwaki and several Sioux tribal nations, under the assertion that the pipeline would threaten sacred burial grounds as well as the quality of water in the area. A protest at the pipeline site in North Dakota, near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, drew international attention.
