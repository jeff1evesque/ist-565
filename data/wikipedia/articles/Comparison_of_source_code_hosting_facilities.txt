A source code repository is a file archive and web hosting facility where a large amount of source code, for software or for web pages, is kept, either publicly or privately. They are often used by open-source software projects and other multi-developer projects to handle various versions. They help developers submit patches of code in an organized fashion. Often these web sites support version control, bug tracking, release management, mailing lists, and wiki-based documentation.
People who write software retain their copyright when their software is posted to any code hosting facilities, including the "non-gnu" section of GNU Savannahâ€”with the exception of contributors to Free Software Foundation (FSF)-copyrighted programs at GNU Savannah.
