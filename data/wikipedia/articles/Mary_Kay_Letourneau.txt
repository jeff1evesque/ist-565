Mary Kay Fualaau (n√©e Schmitz, formerly Mary Kay Letourneau; born January 30, 1962) is an American former schoolteacher who pleaded guilty to two counts of felony second-degree rape of a child, her 12-year-old student, Vili Fualaau. While awaiting sentencing, she gave birth to Fualaau's child. Her plea agreement called for six months in jail, with three months suspended, and no contact with Fualaau for life. The case gained national attention.
Shortly after her three-month stint in jail, Letourneau was caught by police having sex with Fualaau in a car. Judge Linda Lau found that she was in violation of the conditions of the plea agreement, vacated her probation, and re-sentenced her to the maximum of seven years in prison. She soon gave birth to a second daughter, while in prison. She was incarcerated from 1998 to 2004.
When Letourneau was released in 2004, Fualaau, by then over 18 years old, asked the court to dissolve the no-contact order. Judge Lau complied. Letourneau and Fualaau married in May 2005, and she took his last name.  In May 2017, Fualaau filed for legal separation, though he later withdrew the request.
