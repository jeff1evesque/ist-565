Larson's casting was announced at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con International, making it Marvel Studios' first female-led solo film. Boden and Fleck were brought on board to direct in April 2017, and Robertson-Dworet soon took over scripting duties, the story of which borrows elements from the 1971 "Kreeâ€“Skrull War" comic book storyline.

By the start of filming, the remainder of the cast was filled out as were the additional screenwriters.
