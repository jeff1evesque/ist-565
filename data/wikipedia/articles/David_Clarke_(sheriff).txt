David Alexander Clarke Jr. (born August 21, 1956) is a former American law enforcement official who was the Sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin from 2002 to 2017. In 2002, Clarke was appointed sheriff by Governor Scott McCallum and later elected that same year to his first four-year term. He was re-elected in November 2006, 2010, and 2014. Although registered and elected as a Democrat in a heavily Democratic county, many of Clarke's political views align with those of conservative Republicans. Clarke frequently appears as a guest on Fox News and was a speaker at the 2016 Republican National Convention. He resigned as sheriff in August 2017. A vocal supporter of President Donald Trump, Clarke was considered for a role in the Trump administration. After resigning as sheriff, Clarke joined the super PAC America First Action as a spokesman and senior advisor.
