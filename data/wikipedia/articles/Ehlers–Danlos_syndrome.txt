Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of genetic connective tissue disorders. Symptoms may include loose joints, stretchy skin, and abnormal scar formation. These can be noticed at birth or in early childhood. Complications may include aortic dissection, joint dislocations, scoliosis, chronic pain, or early osteoarthritis.EDSs are due to a mutation in one of more than a dozen different genes. The specific gene affected determines the specific EDS. Some cases result from a new mutation occurring during early development while others are inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive manner. This results in defects in the structure or processing of collagen. The diagnosis may be confirmed with genetic testing or a skin biopsy. People may be misdiagnosed with hypochondriasis, depression, or chronic fatigue syndrome.There is no known cure. Treatment is supportive in nature. Physical therapy and bracing may help strengthen muscles and support joints. While some disorders result in a normal life expectancy, those that affect blood vessels generally result in a shorter life expectancy.EDSs affect about 1 in 5,000 people globally. The prognosis depends on the specific disorder. Excess mobility was first described by Hippocrates in 400 BC. The syndromes are named after two physicians, Edvard Ehlers from Denmark and Henri-Alexandre Danlos from France, who described them at the turn of the 20th century.
