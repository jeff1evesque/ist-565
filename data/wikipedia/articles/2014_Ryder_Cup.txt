The 40th Ryder Cup matches were held 26–28 September 2014 in Scotland on the PGA Centenary Course at the Gleneagles Hotel near Auchterarder in Perthshire. This was the second Ryder Cup held in Scotland; it was previously at Muirfield in 1973. The team captains in 2014 were Paul McGinley for Europe and Tom Watson for the USA.
Europe were the defending cup holders, having won in 2012 at Medinah Country Club near Chicago.
Europe won the 2014 competition to retain the Ryder Cup, defeating the USA by 16½ points to 11½, for their third consecutive win.
