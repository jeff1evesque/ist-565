Medusa (Medusalith Amaquelin-Boltagon) is a fictional character, a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Her name and character are derived from Greek mythology as her hair displays similar qualities to that of Medusa the Gorgon's hair. Medusa has psychokinetic control over her hair, a power she obtained through Terrigenesis. Due to this, she is able to expand it to double its normal length, pick locks with it, remotely lift objects (both animate and inanimate), and she often uses it as a rope to contain objects and people.
She made her live-action debut in the 2017 television series Inhumans, portrayed by Serinda Swan and "V.I.P.".
