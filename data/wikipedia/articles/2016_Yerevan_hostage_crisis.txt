On 17 July 2016, a group of armed men calling themselves the Daredevils of Sasun (Armenian: Սասնա Ծռեր Sasna Tsrrer; the name is taken from an epic poem) stormed a police station in Yerevan, Armenia, and took nine hostages. They demanded the release of opposition leader Jirair Sefilian, and the resignation of President Serzh Sargsyan. Two policemen were killed in the attack. The group began a standoff with government forces, with growing crowds of protesters joining the calls for the resignation of the president. In a 2017 survey the 38% of respondents supported Sasna Tsrer's actions, while 16% condemned.
