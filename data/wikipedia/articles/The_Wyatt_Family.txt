The Wyatt Family was a professional wrestling stable in WWE originally composed of Bray Wyatt, Erick Rowan and Luke Harper.
The Wyatt Family debuted in WWE's developmental branch NXT in November 2012, with Harper and Rowan going on to win the NXT Tag Team Championship. They would go on to debut on the main roster in July 2013, as a villainous faction terrorizing other WWE wrestlers, including Kane, CM Punk, Daniel Bryan, John Cena, Sheamus and members of The Shield, among others.
The original incarnation of the group began to go their separate ways in September 2014, after Wyatt announced he was "setting Harper and Rowan free". As a result, Rowan would turn into a heroic character by joining Cena's team at Survivor Series, while Harper would remain villainous and side with The Authority. Following a brief feud, Harper and Rowan would reunite in May 2015. 
In August 2015, Braun Strowman joined The Wyatt Family, but was later withdrawn from the stable as a result of the 2016 WWE draft. In late 2016, with the addition of Randy Orton, The Wyatt Family won the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, holding the titles under the Freebird Rule. After they lost the tag team titles, Harper betrayed Wyatt and departed from the group. Orton won the 2017 Royal Rumble match and Wyatt proceeded to win his first WWE Championship in February, with the pair going on to face each other at WrestleMania 33. Wyatt and Rowan continued their alliance as the last remaining members of The Wyatt Family until the 2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up, in which Wyatt was moved to Raw while Rowan remained on SmackDown, thus disbanding The Wyatt Family. However, Erick Rowan and Luke Harper would be repackaged together as The Bludgeon Brothers where they would win the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, the second time for Harper.
