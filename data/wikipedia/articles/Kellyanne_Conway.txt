Kellyanne Elizabeth Conway (n√©e Fitzpatrick; born January 20, 1967) is an American pollster, political consultant, and pundit who is currently serving as Counselor to the President in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. She was previously Trump's campaign manager, having been appointed in August 2016. Conway is the first woman to have run a successful U.S. presidential campaign. She has previously held roles as campaign manager and strategist in the Republican Party, and was formerly president and CEO of The Polling Company, Inc./WomanTrend.Despite living in Trump World Tower for seven years from 2001 to 2008 and having conducted private polls for Trump in late 2013 when he was considering running for Governor of New York, Conway initially endorsed Ted Cruz in the Republican presidential primaries in 2016 and chaired a pro-Cruz political action committee. After Cruz withdrew from the race, Trump appointed Conway as a senior advisor and later campaign manager to his campaign. On December 22, 2016, Trump announced that Conway would join his administration as Counselor to the President.Since Trump's inauguration, Conway has been embroiled in a series of controversies: using the phrase "alternative facts", making reference to a "Bowling Green massacre" that never occurred, and claiming that Michael Flynn had the full confidence of the president hours before he was dismissed. Members of Congress from both parties called for an investigation of an apparent ethics violation after she publicly endorsed commercial products associated with the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump.On November 29, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Conway would oversee White House efforts to combat the opioid overdose epidemic.
