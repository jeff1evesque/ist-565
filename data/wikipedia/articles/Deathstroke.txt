Deathstroke (Slade Joseph Wilson) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is a mercenary and assassin who serves as the archenemy of the Teen Titans, specifically Dick Grayson. Over the years, writers have developed him as an adversary of other superheroes in the DC Universe as well, such as Batman and Green Arrow.
Deathstroke has been ranked as the 24th Greatest Villain of All Time by Wizard magazine, and as the 32nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time by IGN. The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into multiple forms of media, including several Batman-related projects and the Teen Titans animated series. He has been portrayed in live-action by Manu Bennett on The CW's television series Arrow, and by Joe Manganiello in the DC Extended Universe, beginning with a cameo in the 2017 film Justice League.
