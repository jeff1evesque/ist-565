Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is a type of brain inflammation due to antibodies. Early symptoms may include fever, headache, and feeling tired. This is then typically followed by psychosis which presents with false beliefs (delusions) and seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear (hallucinations). People are also often agitated or confused. Over time seizures, decreased breathing, and blood pressure and heart rate variability typically occur.About half of cases are associated with tumors, most commonly teratomas of the ovaries, while the cause in others cases is unclear. The underlying mechanism is autoimmune with the primary target the GluN1 subunit of the N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) in the brain. Diagnosis is typically based on finding specific antibodies in the cerebral spinal fluid. MRI of the brain is often normal. Misdiagnosis is common.Treatment is typically with immunosuppresive medication and, if a tumor is present surgery to remove it. With treatment about 80% of people have a good outcome. Outcomes are better if treatment is begun earlier. Long term mental or behavioral problems may remain. About 4% of those affected die from the condition. Reoccurrence occurs in about 10% of people.The condition is relatively common. About 80% of those affected are female. It typically occurs in adults less than 45 years old but can occur at any age. The disease was first described by Josep Dalmau in 2007.
