American Gods is an American fantasy drama television series based on the novel of the same name, written by Neil Gaiman and developed by Bryan Fuller and Michael Green  for the premium cable network Starz. Produced by FremantleMedia North America and distributed by Lionsgate Television, the series premiered on April 30, 2017. Ricky Whittle plays the series' lead Shadow Moon, who meets a strange man named Mr. Wednesday (Ian McShane) after being released from prison, and soon becomes embroiled in a large-scale conflict between the Old Gods and the New Gods, who grow stronger each day. Fuller and Green served as the showrunners for the first season, and are set to be replaced by Jesse Alexander for the second season.

Since its debut, the series has received critical acclaim, with praise for the performances and visual style. It received two nominations at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Main Title Design and Outstanding Special Visual Effects, but did not win in either category. It also received three nominations at the 8th Critics' Choice Television Awards, including Best Drama Series, Best Actor in a Drama Series for McShane and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for Gillian Anderson.
