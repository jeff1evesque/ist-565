Jersey Shore is an American reality television series that ran on MTV from December 3, 2009 to December 20, 2012 in the United States. The series follows the lives of eight housemates who spend their summer together at a vacation home: in Seaside Heights, New Jersey in seasons one, three, five and six, and in South Beach, Florida and Florence, Italy in seasons two and four, respectively.
The show debuted amid controversy regarding its use of the terms "Guido/Guidette", its portrayal of Italian-Americans and allegations of perpetuating stereotypes, as well as scrutiny from locals of the cast who were not residents of the area.The show became a pop culture phenomenon, with classes and conferences at universities about the show, and journalists listing it as one of the most notable shows of the time. The Shore franchise spawned several international adaptations in other countries. Four of the Jersey Shore cast members received spin-off shows on MTV, with the most successful being Snooki & JWOWW. Most of the cast would go on to appear in other reality programs or receive their own shows on various networks.
On August 12, 2017, it was announced that the cast (with the exception of Ortiz-Magro, Cortese and Guadagnino) would reunite for a one-off television special not produced by 495 Productions called Reunion Road Trip: Return to the Jersey Shore, which premiered on E! on August 20, 2017. On November 27, 2017, MTV announced that the cast (with the exception of Giancola) would be reuniting in Miami, Florida for a new reunion series titled Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. The series is set to premiere globally on April 5, 2018. According to MTV, it is considered a new series and not the seventh season of the original show.
