William Lamport (1611–1659) was an Irish Catholic adventurer, known in Mexico as Don Guillén de Lampart (or Lombardo) y Guzmán. He was tried by the Mexican Inquisition for sedition and executed in 1659. He claimed to be a bastard son of King Philip III of Spain (r. 1598-1621) and therefore the half-brother of King Philip IV.
In 1642 he tried to foment rebellion against the Spanish crown, with the aid of blacks and Indians, as well as creole merchants, but was denounced by a man he had hoped to recruit for his plan and arrested, languishing in the Inquisition jail for 17 years. A statue of Lamport is immediately inside the monument to Independence ("the Angel") in Mexico City.
