WrestleMania is a professional wrestling event produced annually between mid-March to early April by WWE, an American professional wrestling promotion based in Stamford, Connecticut. WWE first produced the event in 1985 and has since produced 34 editions, with the most recent having been held in New Orleans, Louisiana on April 8, 2018. WrestleMania, WWE's flagship event, airs on pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network and is the most successful and longest-running professional wrestling event in history. It contributes to the worldwide commercial success of WWE through media, merchandise, and shows. WrestleMania was conceptualized by WWE owner Vince McMahon and long time WWE ring announcer and Hall of Famer Howard Finkel is credited with devising the name "WrestleMania" in 1984.
