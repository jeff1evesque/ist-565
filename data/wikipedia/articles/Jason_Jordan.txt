Nathan Everhart (born September 28, 1988) is an American professional wrestler and former amateur wrestler. He is signed to WWE, where he performs on the Raw brand under the ring name Jason Jordan. As of February 2018, he is on hiatus due to a neck injury.
Everhart signed a WWE contract in 2011 and was sent to its developmental territory Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), before debuting in NXT the following year. In 2015, he formed the tag team American Alpha with Chad Gable, with the duo capturing the NXT Tag Team Championships before being drafted to SmackDown and winning the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. In 2017, American Alpha disbanded when Jordan debuted on the Raw brand as the storyline son of Raw General Manager Kurt Angle. He is the first and, thus far, only man to win the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT Tag Team Championships. He also held the FCW Tag Team Championship before FCW became NXT.
