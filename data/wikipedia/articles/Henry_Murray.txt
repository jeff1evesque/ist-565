Henry Alexander Murray (May 13, 1893 â€“ June 23, 1988) was an American psychologist at Harvard University. He was Director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the School of Arts and Sciences after 1930. Murray developed a theory of personality called personology, based on "need" and "press".  Murray was also a co-developer, with Christiana Morgan, of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), which he referred to as "the second best-seller that Harvard ever published, second only to the Harvard Handbook of Music." Murray is also noteworthy in popular culture for his links to future domestic terrorist Ted Kaczynski, whom Murray subjected to a set of unethical and psychologically-damaging experiments from 1959 to 1962.
