Nguyễn Văn Lém (Vietnamese: [ŋʷǐənˀ vān lɛ̌m]; 1931 or 1932 – 1 February 1968), often referred to as Bảy Lốp was summarily executed in Saigon, during the Vietnam War. Lem was a Viet Cong member captured during the early part of the Tet Offensive, where Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces forces launched a massive surprise attack.
He was brought to Brigadier General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan who then executed him. The event was witnessed and recorded by Võ Sửu, a cameraman for NBC, and Eddie Adams, an Associated Press photographer. The photo and film became two famous images in contemporary American journalism.
