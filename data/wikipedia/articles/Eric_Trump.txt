Eric Frederick Trump (born January 6, 1984) is an American businessman, philanthropist, and former reality television personality. He is the third child and second son of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Ivana Trump. Alongside his older brother Donald Trump Jr., he serves as a trustee of The Trump Organization.
A fourth-generation businessman who followed in the footsteps of his great-grandmother Elizabeth Trump (who founded the company), grandfather Fred Trump, and father, Trump has served as a longtime executive vice president of the firm; Trump and his brother Donald Jr. are currently running the company during their father's administration. From 2007 to 2016, he led The Eric Trump Foundation, a charity that raised money for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. In June 2017, it was reported that the Eric Trump Foundation shifted a portion of that money to the Trump Organization ostensibly to cover the expenses of various fundraising events, though charity experts say there was no reasonable cost justification. Trump denies any wrongdoing and pledges to cooperate with any official review of the matter.
