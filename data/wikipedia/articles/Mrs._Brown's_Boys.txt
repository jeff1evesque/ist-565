Mrs. Brown's Boys is a British and Irish television sitcom created by and starring Irishman Brendan O'Carroll. It was produced in the United Kingdom by BBC Scotland in partnership with BocPix and RTÃ‰. O'Carroll himself plays his drag persona, Agnes Brown, with several close friends and family members making up the rest of the cast. The show adopts an informal production style where production mistakes and tomfoolery, mostly instigated by O'Carroll, are edited into each episode. Despite being lambasted by critics, the show has become a ratings success in both Ireland, where it is set, and Britain, where it is recorded. It is also gaining increasingly higher ratings in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The show has won numerous awards.
Mrs. Brown's Boys was developed from O'Carroll's works going back to the early 1990s. The character, Agnes Browne, first appeared in stage plays, radio plays, books, and straight-to-DVD films. For the sitcom, the spelling of Agnes's surname was shortened from Browne to Brown. A stage show has continued to run, and during February and March 2014 it toured Australia.  A feature film, Mrs. Brown's Boys D'Movie, was released on 27 June 2014.
