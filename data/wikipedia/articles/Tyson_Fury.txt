Tyson Luke Fury (born 12 August 1988) is a British professional boxer. In 2015 he won the unified WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO, Ring magazine and lineal heavyweight titles, after defeating long-reigning world champion Wladimir Klitschko. The victory earned Fury Fighter of the Year and Upset of the Year awards by The Ring.
He was subsequently stripped of the IBF title later that year for being unable to grant a fight against their mandatory challenger, Vyacheslav Glazkov, due to agreeing to a rematch with Klitschko. In 2016, Fury vacated the WBA, WBO, IBO, and lineal titles following a medical investigation and personal issues, and two cancellations of the Klitschko rematch. In 2018, following more than two years of inactivity, The Ring stripped him of his last remaining title. In August 2016, Fury was ranked by BoxRec as the world's sixth best active boxer, pound for pound.
Having initially been denied the opportunity to fight for Ireland at the Olympic Games, Fury was permitted to represent both Great Britain and Ireland after tracing his family lineage to relatives in Belfast and Galway. He has represented both England and Ireland as an amateur, winning the ABA super-heavyweight title in 2008 before turning professional later that year. At regional level he held the British and English heavyweight titles twice each, as well as the European, Commonwealth, and Irish heavyweight titles.
