However, despite his defensive abilities, he has also drawn criticism due to his tendency to pick up cards, as he has occasionally shown violent or unsportsmanlike behaviour, which includes diving, on the pitch.Born and raised in Brazil, Pepe opted to play for the Portugal national team, playing at three FIFA World Cups and three UEFA European Championships. He was a member of the team that won UEFA Euro 2016, also reaching the semi-final of Euro 2012. His father named him Kepler Laveran in honor to scientists Johannes Kepler and Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran.
