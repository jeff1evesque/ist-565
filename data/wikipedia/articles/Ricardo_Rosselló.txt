Ricardo Antonio "Ricky" Rosselló Nevares  (born March 7, 1979) is a Puerto Rican politician and scientist, and is currently the Governor of Puerto Rico. He is the son of former governor Pedro Rosselló.
Rosselló came to public life after his father Pedro Rosselló was elected as governor of Puerto Rico in 1992 and 1996. At the time, Ricardo was mostly known for his academic and athletic accomplishments, having represented Puerto Rico internationally in the International Mathematical Olympiads and by becoming a three-time junior tennis champion on the island.
Initially, however, Rosselló dedicated himself to the sciences. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering and economics and, later on, graduated from the University of Michigan with a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering.After obtaining his doctoral degree, Rosselló worked as a researcher at Duke University, focusing his work on stem cell research. He then published and presented his research on several venues while obtaining several awards in the process.
But after a few years in academia, Rosselló returned to the public life. In 2010, he founded the political advocacy group Boricua ¡Ahora Es! that advocated for changing the current political status of Puerto Rico. After several years of political advocacy, Rosselló announced that he would seek the nomination for governor of Puerto Rico under the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish). Several months later he was elected governor during the 2016 general election.
Rosselló's political stances tend to be centrist on social issues. For instance, he supports legalization of medical marijuana but opposes its legalization for recreational use. In terms of civil rights, Rosselló opposes same-sex marriage but respects the U.S. Supreme Court decision that established it.
