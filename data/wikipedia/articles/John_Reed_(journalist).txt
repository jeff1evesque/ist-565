John Silas "Jack" Reed (October 22, 1887 â€“ October 17, 1920) was an American journalist, poet, and socialist activist, best remembered for Ten Days That Shook the World, his first-hand account of the Bolshevik Revolution. He married the writer and feminist Louise Bryant in 1916. Reed died of typhus in Russia in 1920, and is one of only three Americans buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis (the others being labor organizer Bill Haywood and Charles Ruthenburg, founder of the Communist Party USA).
