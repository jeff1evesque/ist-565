Frances Ruth Shand Kydd (previously Spencer, née Roche; 20 January 1936 – 3 June 2004) was the mother of Diana, Princess of Wales. As such, she was the maternal grandmother of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, respectively second and sixth in the line of succession to the British throne. Following her divorce from Viscount Althorp in 1969, and later Diana's death in 1997, Shand Kydd devoted the final years of her life to Roman Catholic charity work.
