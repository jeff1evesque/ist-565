Calvin Johnson Jr.  (born September 29, 1985) is a former American football wide receiver. He was drafted by the Detroit Lions of the National Football League, second overall in the 2007 NFL Draft, and played for the Lions for all of his professional career before he retired. He previously played college football at Georgia Tech, where he was twice recognized as an All-American.
On March 14, 2012, Johnson signed an eight-year, US$132 million contract extension with the Lions, one of the largest sports contracts ever.
Johnson had a rare combination of size (6 ft 5 in and 239 lbs), catching ability, speed (40-yard dash in 4.35 seconds), strength, leaping ability, and body control. His nickname, "Megatron", a Transformers character, was given to him by Lions teammate Roy Williams, and the name caught on with fans.
On December 22, 2012, Johnson broke Jerry Rice's single-season record for receiving yards, which had previously been 1,848, and finished the 2012 season with 1,964 yards, an average of almost 123 yards per game. In that same game versus the Atlanta Falcons, Johnson also set the NFL records for consecutive 100-yard games (8) and consecutive games with 10 or more receptions (4). He tied Michael Irvin's record for most 100-yard games in a season with 11.
