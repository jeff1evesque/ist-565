The Turpin case is an alleged child abuse and captivity incident discovered in Perris, California, United States, in which David and Louise Turpin allegedly imprisoned their thirteen children for years or even decades. On January 14, 2018, one of the children escaped and contacted police who, on entering the home, found some of the children in a dark, foul-smelling room. The siblings ranged in age from 2 to 29, with seven of the thirteen children being over the age of 18 at the time of the parents' arrest.
The Turpins allegedly shackled, beat and strangled their children, allowing them to eat just once per day and shower just once per year. According to investigators, the older ones were so malnourished that they appeared to be much younger. The eldest, a 29-year-old woman, weighed just 82 pounds (37 kg). Some of the siblings appeared to lack basic knowledge of the world, being unfamiliar with what medicine and police were.The couple were arrested and detained but pleaded not guilty to all charges. Various legal charges and court hearings followed in the succeeding months. The case is considered "extraordinary for numerous reasons", such as the alleged abuse being done to multiple children by two parents (whereas abuse with only one child victim is more common), and according to Dr. Bernard Gallagher, because "you don't often get cases of children being tortured, where the abuse seems calculated".
