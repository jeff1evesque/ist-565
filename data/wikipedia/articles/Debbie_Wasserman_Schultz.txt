Deborah Wasserman Schultz (); born September 27, 1966, is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Florida's 23rd congressional district, first elected to Congress in 2004. She is a member of the Democratic Party and was a former Chairwoman for the Democratic National Committee.
Wasserman Schultz had served in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate and was a national campaign co-chair for Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2008 run for president. She is the first Jewish representative elected from Florida. Her district covered 
much of southern Broward County, including a large portion of Fort Lauderdale. It also covers much of northern Miami-Dade County.
Wasserman Schultz was elected chairperson of the Democratic National Committee in May 2011, replacing Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. On July 24, 2016, Wasserman Schultz announced her resignation from her position after WikiLeaks released a collection of hacked emails indicating that Wasserman Schultz and other members of the DNC staff had been biased against the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders in favor of Hillary Clinton's campaign. Her resignation was finalized on July 28 after the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She was subsequently appointed honorary chair of the Clinton campaign's "50 state program."[73]
