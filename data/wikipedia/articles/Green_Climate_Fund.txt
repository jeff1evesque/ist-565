The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a fund established within the framework of the UNFCCC as an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices to counter climate change. The GCF is based in the Incheon, South Korea. It is governed by a Board of 24 members and supported by a Secretariat.
The objective of the Green Climate Fund is to "support projects, programmes, policies and other activities in developing country Parties using thematic funding windows". It is intended that the Green Climate Fund be the centrepiece of efforts to raise Climate Finance under the UNFCCC.
According to the Climate & Development Knowledge Network, at the third meeting of the Board in Berlin in March 2013, members agreed on how to move forward with the fund's Business Model Framework (BMF). They identified the need to assess various options for how nations could access the fund, approaches for involving the private sector, plus ways to measure results and ensure requests for monies are country-driven. At the fourth Board meeting in June 2013, Hela Cheikhrouhou, a Tunisian national, was selected to become the Fund's first Executive Director. Cheikhrouhou left the fund in September 2016. Ms. Cheikhrouhou was succeeded by Australian national Howard Bamsey, who took office on 10 January 2017. Mr. Bamsey resigned from his position as Executive Director on 4 July 2018, at the completion of the 20th meeting of the Board which was dominated by "challenging and difficult discussions between Board members"[1] without any climate finance being approved. The position of Executive Director is temporarily observed by Javier Manzanares until a replacement is appointed by the Board.
