New Year's Eve in London, a New Year's Eve firework display, is celebrated along the Victoria Embankment and South Bank areas of the River Thames where the London Eye and Big Ben are situated. The countdown is accompanied by the chimes of Big Ben, and a digital countdown timer projected onto the Shell Centre, until 2017. The fireworks are launched off the London Eye at midnight. A company, Titanium Fireworks are responsible for the pyrotechnics.
