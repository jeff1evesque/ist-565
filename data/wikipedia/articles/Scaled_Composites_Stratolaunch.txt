The Scaled Composites Stratolaunch is an aircraft being built for Stratolaunch Systems by Scaled Composites to carry air launch to orbit rockets.
It was announced in December 2011 and rolled out in May 2017; it should make its first launch demonstration in 2019.
The twin-fuselage design is the largest by wingspan, could carry a 550,000 lb (250 t) payload for a 1,300,000 lb (590 t) maximum take-off weight and should launch up to three Pegasus XL rockets.
