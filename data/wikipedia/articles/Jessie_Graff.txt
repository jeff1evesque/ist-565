She is a black belt in Taekwondo, a black sash in Kung Fu, and is trained in five other styles of martial arts. She is also a championship pole vaulter and  a competitive gymnast.Graff has become well known for her athletic achievements on the obstacle course show American Ninja Warrior, including in 2016 becoming the first woman ever to complete Stage 1 of the Las Vegas Finals course and only the second woman ever to conquer the Stage 1 of the Sasuke franchise worldwide (excluding Kunoichi), after Chie Tanabe in SASUKE 2. In 2017, Graff became the first woman to compete in, and to successfully finish, Stage 2 in Las Vegas, although this was part of the USA vs. The World competition instead of a regular season, and that had no time requirement. She was the first woman representing the United States in that competition. Later on in Sasuke 34, she became the first and so far the only woman worldwide to finish Stage 2 in the Sasuke/Ninja Warrior franchise, only defeated by Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger later in Stage 3.
