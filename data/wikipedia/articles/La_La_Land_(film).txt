La La Land is a 2016 American musical romantic comedy drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle. It stars Ryan Gosling as a jazz pianist and Emma Stone as an aspiring actress, both of whom meet and fall in love in Los Angeles while pursuing their dreams.
Having been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle first conceptualised the film alongside Justin Hurwitz while attending Harvard University together. Moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Chazelle wrote the screenplay but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. Following the success of his 2014 film Whiplash, the project was picked up by Summit Entertainment. Filming took place in various Los Angeles locations from August to September 2015, with the film's score composed by Hurwitz and the dance choreography by Mandy Moore. La La Land premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 9, 2016. It grossed $446 million worldwide against a production budget of $30 million.
La La Land was praised, especially for Chazelle's screenplay and direction, Gosling and Stone's performances, Hurwitz's musical score, and the musical numbers. It won in every category for which it was nominated at the 74th Golden Globe Awards, with a record-breaking seven wins, and received 11 nominations at the 70th British Academy Film Awards, winning five. The film received 14 nominations at the 89th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, tying the record for the most Oscar nominations with All About Eve (1950) and Titanic (1997). It ultimately won six: Best Director, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Original Song ("City of Stars"), and Best Production Design.
