Split is a 2016 American psychological horror film written, co-produced and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and starring James McAvoy, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Betty Buckley. The film follows a man with 23 different personalities who kidnaps and imprisons three teenage girls in an isolated underground facility. One of his darker personalities manifests within his psyche and results in his eventual transformation into a merciless and cannibalistic sociopath with superhuman abilities.
Principal photography began on November 11, 2015, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The film premiered at Fantastic Fest on September 26, 2016, and was released in the United States on January 20, 2017, by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews, with McAvoy's performance earning high praise and some critics labeling it a welcome return for Shyamalan, although some criticized the film for its perceived stigmatization of mental illness. The film grossed $278 million worldwide on a budget of $9 million, with over 2,000% return on investment (ROI), making it the most profitable film of 2017 and the 11th most profitable film of all time.
The film is a stand-alone sequel to the 2000 film Unbreakable, which was also written, produced, and directed by Shyamalan, and is the second installment in what has been referred to as the Eastrail 177 trilogy, or the Unbreakable series. The film was not marketed as a sequel. The final part of the trilogy, titled Glass, is scheduled to be released in 2019, and will combine the casts and characters of both previous films.
