Kalief Browder (May 25, 1993 â€“ June 6, 2015) was an African American man from The Bronx, New York. In 2010, at the age of 16, Browder was accused of the theft of a backpack and its contents including a camera, $700, a credit card, and an iPod Touch. Awaiting trial, Browder was imprisoned on Rikers Island for three years with significant time in solitary confinement. He was released when the prosecutor's case was found lacking in evidence and the case's main witness was found to have left the United States. Two years following his release from prison, Browder died by suicide, hanging himself from an air conditioning unit outside of his mother's home. Browder's supporters say his suicide was the result of mental and physical abuse sustained in prison. His case has been cited by activists who call for the reform of the New York City criminal justice system, and attracted widespread attention in the years following his death. In 2017, Jay Z and Harvey Weinstein released the docuseries, Time: The Kalief Browder Story.
