Gods of Egypt is a 2016 fantasy action film directed by Alex Proyas and portraying ancient Egyptian deities. It stars Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Chadwick Boseman, Ã‰lodie Yung, Courtney Eaton, Rufus Sewell and Geoffrey Rush. The film portrays a mortal Egyptian hero who partners with the Egyptian god Horus to save the world from Set and rescue his love.Filming took place in Australia under the American film production and distribution company Summit Entertainment. While the film's production budget was $140 million, the parent company Lionsgate's financial exposure was less than $10 million due to tax incentives and pre-sales. The Australian government provided a tax credit for 46% of the film's budget. When Lionsgate began promoting the film in November 2015, it received backlash for its predominantly white cast playing Egyptian deities. In response, Lionsgate and director Proyas apologized for ethnically-inaccurate casting.
Lionsgate released Gods of Egypt in theaters globally, starting on February 25, 2016, in 2D, RealD 3D, and IMAX 3D, and in the United States, Canada, and 68 other markets on February 26. The film was poorly reviewed by critics, who criticized its choice of cast, script, acting and special effects; these reviews prompted an angry response from Proyas. It grossed a total of $150 million against a $140 million budget, becoming a box office bomb and losing the studio up to $90 million. It received five nominations at the 37th Golden Raspberry Awards.
