The Atracidae, commonly known as Australian funnel-web spiders, are a family of mygalomorph spiders. They have been included as a subfamily of Hexathelidae, but are now recognized as a separate family. All members of the family are native to Australia. Atracidae consists of three genera: Atrax, Hadronyche, and Illawarra, comprising 35 species. A number of the species produce venom which is dangerous to humans and bites by spiders of six of the species have caused severe injuries to victims. The bite of the Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus) is potentially deadly, but no fatalities have occurred since the introduction of modern first-aid techniques and antivenom.
