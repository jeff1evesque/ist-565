Orrin Grant Hatch (born March 22, 1934) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States Senator for Utah who has been the President pro tempore of the United States Senate since 2015. Having been a senator since 1977, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history. He is also one of two remaining Republican members of the Senate, along with Chuck Grassley, to have served during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.
Hatch served as either the chair or ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993 to 2005. He previously served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee as well as serving on the board of directors for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
After the Republicans won control of the Senate during the 2014 midterms, Hatch became the President pro tempore of the Senate on January 6, 2015, after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in. In 2018, Hatch announced that he would retire at the end of his seventh term in the Senate, in January 2019.
