Tamerlan Anzorovich Tsarnaev (; October 21, 1986 â€“ April 19, 2013) was a Russian-Kyrgyz terrorist of Chechen descent who, with his brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, planted bombs at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others. Tsarnaev was of half-Chechen and half-Avar descent. He came to the United States in 2004. At the time of the bombings, Tsarnaev was an aspiring boxer who authorities believe had recently become a follower of Islamic extremism.Shortly after the Federal Bureau of Investigation declared them suspects in the bombings and released images of them, the Tsarnaev brothers killed an MIT policeman, carjacked an SUV, and engaged in a shootout with the police in the Boston suburb of Watertown. According to the federal indictment, during the shootout Tsarnaev was captured but died, partly as a result of his brother driving over him, and an MBTA police officer was critically injured in the course of Dzhokhar's escape in the SUV (the latter by what may have been friendly fire). An injured Dzhokhar escaped, but was found, arrested, and hospitalized on the evening of April 19 after an unprecedented manhunt in which thousands of police searched a 20-block area of Watertown.During his incarceration, Tsarnaev's brother allegedly said during questioning that the pair next intended to detonate explosives in Times Square in New York City. Dzhokhar reportedly also said to authorities that he and his brother were radicalized, at least in part, by watching Anwar al-Awlaki lectures.
