John Francis Kelly (born May 11, 1950) is a retired United States Marine Corps general who is the current White House Chief of Staff for President Donald Trump, since July 31, 2017. He had previously served as Secretary of Homeland Security in the Trump administration.
Before entering the Trump administration, Kelly had been the commander of United States Southern Command, the unified combatant command responsible for American military operations in Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. He had previously served as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. Kelly succeeded General Douglas M. Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command on November 19, 2012 and was in turn succeeded by Navy Admiral Kurt W. Tidd on January 14, 2016.
Kelly was appointed Secretary of Homeland Security on January 20, 2017, by President Trump. On July 28, 2017, he was appointed to replace Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff, taking office on July 31, 2017 shortly after Priebus had officially left his post. At a little over six months, Kelly's term as Secretary of Homeland Security is the briefest in the office's relatively short history.
