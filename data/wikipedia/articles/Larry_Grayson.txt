Larry Grayson (31 August 1923 â€“ 7 January 1995), born William Sulley White, was an English comedian and television presenter who was best known in the 1970s and early '80s. He is best remembered for hosting the BBC's popular series The Generation Game and for his high camp and English music hall humour.
His camp stand-up act consisted mainly of anecdotes about a cast of imaginary friends; the most frequently mentioned were Everard and Slack Alice. He is often cited as one of the first gay entertainers to have enjoyed mass appeal, although he never made any reference to his sexuality. He was devoted to his adopted home town of Nuneaton, where a museum display relating to his life and work and a memorial have been established.
