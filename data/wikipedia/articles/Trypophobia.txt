Trypophobia is an aversion to the sight of irregular patterns or clusters of small holes, or bumps.  The condition is not officially recognized as a mental disorder, and is rarely referenced in scientific literature, but may fall under the broad category of specific phobia if fear is involved and the fear is excessive and distressing. People may express only disgust or both fear and disgust to trypophobic imagery.The understanding of trypophobia is limited. Although few studies have been done on trypophobia, researchers hypothesize that it is the result of a biological revulsion that associates trypophobic shapes with danger or disease, and may therefore have an evolutionary basis.The term trypophobia is believed to have been coined by a participant in an online forum in 2005. Since then, the concept of trypophobia has become popular on social media.
