Yolki (Russian: Ёлки, meaning Christmas Trees), also known as Six Degrees of Celebration, is a 2010 Russian comedy film directed by Timur Bekmambetov. As of 2017, six films have been made in the series. It is the most successful non-animated film franchise in Russia.The films in the series represent a Russian tradition of the New Year's Movie where films that take place during the holiday season tap into the vein of hope, optimism, and possibility associated with New Year's in the Russian culture. Other examples include The Irony of Fate and The Irony of Fate 2 (also directed by Bekmambetov). Typically such films are released in December, just before the start of the holidays in Russia.
