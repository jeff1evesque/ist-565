The One Hundred Fifteenth United States Congress is the current meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. It meets in Washington, D.C. from January 3, 2017, to January 3, 2019, during the final weeks of Barack Obama's presidency and the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency.

The November 2016 elections maintained Republican control of both the House and Senate, but"Despite unified party control…, House and Senate GOP majorities struggled to legislate: GOP fissures and an undisciplined, unpopular president frequently undermined the Republican agenda. Most notably, clashes within and between the two parties strained old ways of doing business. In response, Republicans dodged, bent, or reinterpreted several institutional constraints in pursuit of their party’s legislative priorities."According to a 2018 study in The Journal of Politics, "the legislative record of the 115th Congress has been less impressive than that of other recent majority parties in control of unified government." The study argues that this reflected a lack of internal unity in the Republican Party.
