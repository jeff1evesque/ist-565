Michael Benneman Sams (born 11 August 1941) is an English kidnapper, extortionist and murderer. He kidnapped Julie Dart in July 1991 and later murdered her after she tried to escape. He subsequently kidnapped Stephanie Slater in January 1992, eventually releasing her after payment of a ransom. According to Slater, she was raped during her imprisonment, but Sams denied this. 
After he was convicted and imprisoned, Sams continued to commit offences, attacking a female probation officer. He also became notorious for his attempts to sue the prison, first, successfully, for losing his artificial leg, and then because his bed was too hard.
