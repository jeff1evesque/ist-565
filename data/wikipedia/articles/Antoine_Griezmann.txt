Antoine Griezmann (French pronunciation: ​[ɑ̃twan ɡʁijɛzman]; born 21 March 1991) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Atlético Madrid and the French national team.
Born and raised in Mâcon, Griezmann began his senior career as a member of Spanish side Real Sociedad in 2009, with whom he won the Segunda División title in his first season. He departed five seasons later to join Atlético Madrid for a then-club record €30 million. Although featuring mostly as a winger during his time with Sociedad, Griezmann adapted his game in Madrid to become a complete forward, and quickly became the focal point of the team. He would go on to break the club's scoring record for a debut season, and was named in the 2014–15 La Liga Team of the Season. He was also named La Liga Best Player in 2016, nominated for both the 2016 Best FIFA Men's Player and 2016 Ballon d'Or awards, and won the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League.
Griezmann is a former French youth international, representing his country at under-19, under-20 and under-21 level, and was part of the team that won the 2010 UEFA European Under-19 Championship on home soil. He earned his first cap for the senior national team in 2014, and played at that year's World Cup, helping his country to the quarter-finals. At UEFA Euro 2016, France finished runners-up as hosts, while Griezmann was the top goalscorer and was voted the Player of the Tournament. He later won the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a tournament in which he scored four goals, won the Bronze Ball as the third best player, and was named man of the match in the final.
