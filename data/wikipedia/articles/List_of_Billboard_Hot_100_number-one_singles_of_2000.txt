The Billboard Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by Billboard magazine, the data are compiled by Nielsen SoundScan based collectively on each single's weekly physical sales, and airplay. There were 18 number-one singles in 2000. The first of these, Santana's "Smooth", spent two weeks at the top in January, concluding a 12-week run that had begun in October 1999.
During the year, 10 acts each achieved a first U.S. number-one single, either as a lead artist or featured guest, including Aaliyah, Creed, Matchbox Twenty, and NSYNC. Girl group Destiny's Child and singer Christina Aguilera were the only acts to have earned two number-one singles in this year. There were two collaboration singles that reached number-one on the chart: "Maria Maria" by Santana featuring The Product G&B, and "Thank God I Found You" by Mariah Carey featuring Joe and 98 Degrees. With the latter single, Carey set the record for most consecutive years charting a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, with 11 years from 1990 (beginning with "Vision Of Love") through 2000, and became her 15th number-one single on the chart.
Destiny's Child's "Independent Women Part l" is the second-longest-running single of 2000, topping the chart for 7 consecutive weeks, with another four consecutive weeks in the 2001 chart year. Santana's "Maria Maria" is the longest-running single, staying at number one for 10 straight weeks. Other singles with extended chart run include pop singer Madonna's "Music" and Christina Aguilera's "Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)", each of which topped the chart for four weeks.
