Robert Barisford Brown (born February 5, 1969) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer and actor. Brown started his career in the R&B and pop group New Edition, from its inception in 1978 until his exit from the group in 1985. Starting a solo career, he enjoyed success with his second album in 1988, Don't Be Cruel, which spawned a number of hit singles including the self-penned "My Prerogative", and the Grammy Award-winning "Every Little Step" which became his signature song. Brown had a string of top ten hits on various Billboard charts between 1986 and 1993. Brown is noted as a pioneer of new jack swing, a fusion of hip-hop and R&B. He also starred in films such as A Thin Line Between Love and Hate, and Two Can Play That Game. He returned to New Edition for a reunion album and tour from 1996 to 1997, and returned with all six members for another stint in 2005.
From 1992 to 2007 Brown was married to singer Whitney Houston, with whom he had daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown. The couple starred in the reality show Being Bobby Brown.
