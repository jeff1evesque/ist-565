In the United States, net neutrality, the principle that Internet service providers  treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate, has been an issue of contention between network users and access providers since the 1990s.In 2005, the Federal Communications Commission adopted network neutrality principles "to preserve and promote the vibrant and open character of the Internet as the telecommunications marketplace enters the broadband age." Between 2005 and 2012, five attempts to pass bills in Congress containing net neutrality provisions failed. Opponents claimed that these bills would have benefited industry lobbyists instead of consumers. Large broadband Internet access service providers (ISPs) challenged the FCC's network neutrality principles, and in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that because the FCC classified broadband ISPs as "information services," governed by Title I of the Communications Act of 1934, rather than "common carrier services," governed by Title II, the FCC could not regulate the ISPs so closely. The FCC responded on February 26, 2015 by reclassifying broadband ISPs as common carriers under Title II. These rules went into effect on June 12, 2015. In June 2016, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia upheld the FCC's new net neutrality rules.
Upon becoming FCC chairman in April 2017 as part of the Trump Administration, Ajit Pai proposed to repeal the neutrality policies. The FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on May 14, 2017, generating over 20 million public comments, and on December 14, 2017, the FCC voted in favor of repealing these policies, 3â€“2, along party lines.  Twenty-two state Attorneys General then sued the FCC, alleging among other things that the comment process had been corrupted. On June 11, 2018, the repeal of the FCC's rules took effect, despite a U.S. Senate vote to uphold the regulation.
