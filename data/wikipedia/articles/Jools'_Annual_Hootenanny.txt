Hootenanny is an annual show presented by Jools Holland and broadcast on New Year's Eve as an end of year special of his television series Later... with Jools Holland. It is generally broadcast between 11pm on 31 December and between 1 and 2am the following morning in the United Kingdom on BBC Two.
The pre-recorded show features a Hogmanay party atmosphere with all the guests (drawn from across the world of showbusiness) and other guest audience members present, and the artists themselves getting involved alongside a variety of musical acts by the artists from various genres who perform both before and after midnight. There is a countdown to the midnight start of the New Year, followed by a traditional rendition of "Auld Lang Syne", often with the Pipes and Drums of the Scots Guards. Among the regular events of the evening is the spot where Holland asks actor and comedian Rowland Rivron his predictions for the year ahead/his New Year's resolutions. Editions also feature a white-suited man with a clock for a face named Father Time or Clockman.
