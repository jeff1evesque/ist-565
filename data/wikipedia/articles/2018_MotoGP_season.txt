Valentino Rossi is in second and Jorge Lorenzo in third, the latter with three wins, while Rossi remains winless. Andrea Dovizioso and Cal Crutchlow were the other race winners. Yamaha suffered their worst winless streak in their history with 23 races which had started from the 2017 German Grand Prix.
