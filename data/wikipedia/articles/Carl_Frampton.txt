Carl Frampton,  (born 21 February 1987) is a professional boxer from Northern Ireland. He has held the WBO interim featherweight title since April 2018, and is a former world champion in two weight classes, having held the unified WBA (Super) and IBF super-bantamweight titles between 2014 and 2016, and the WBA (Super) featherweight title from 2016 to 2017. At regional level he held the European and Commonwealth super-bantamweight titles between 2011 and 2014.
By winning the featherweight world title in 2016, Frampton became the first boxer from Northern Ireland and only the second boxer from Ireland (after Steve Collins) to have held world titles in two weight classes. This earned him Fighter of the Year awards by The Ring magazine, the Boxing Writers Association of America, and ESPN.
As of July 2018, Frampton is ranked as the world's second best active featherweight by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, The Ring, and BoxRec.
