Horizon Zero Dawn is an action role-playing video game developed by Guerrilla Games and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in early 2017. The plot revolves around Aloy, a hunter living in a world overrun by machines. Having been an outcast her whole life, she sets out to discover the dangers that kept her sheltered. The player uses ranged weapons, a spear and stealth tactics to combat the mechanised creatures, whose remains can be looted for resources. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and passive bonuses. The game features an open world environment for Aloy to explore, while undertaking side and main story quests.
Development began in 2011 after the studio completed production of Killzone 3, with game director Mathijs de Jonge considering it "the most risky" idea of those that were pitched at the time. The concept explores the contrast between the beauty and danger of the game's setting. The game engine, Decima, was developed for Killzone Shadow Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn. Anthropologists were consulted to authenticate the world's decay over a millennium. The game is the first new intellectual property (IP) developed by Guerrilla Games since Killzone in 2004, and also the studio's first attempt at developing a role-playing video game. The soundtrack, led by Joris de Man, contains experimental instrumentation to distinguish the themes.
Horizon Zero Dawn was well received by critics, who praised the open world, story, visuals, combat, the character of Aloy and the performance provided by her voice actress Ashly Burch, whilst giving criticism to the dialogue, melee combat and character models. It won various awards and accolades and was the best-selling launch of an original IP on the PlayStation 4; selling over seven million copies by February 2018, which ranks it among the best-selling games on the PlayStation 4. An expansion, The Frozen Wilds, was released in November 2017.
