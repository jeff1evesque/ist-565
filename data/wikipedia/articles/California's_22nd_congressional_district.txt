California's 22nd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of California.  The district is currently represented by Republican Devin Nunes.  
The 22nd congressional district is centered in the San Joaquin Valley, in Fresno and Tulare counties. The district includes most of eastern Fresno, as well as all of Clovis, Tulare, and Visalia. 
From 2002â€“2013 the 22nd formerly covered parts of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and Los Angeles counties. The district was anchored in Bakersfield and took in most of San Luis Obispo County. Most of that district is now the 23rd district, while the current 22nd covers most of the territory previously in the 21st district.
