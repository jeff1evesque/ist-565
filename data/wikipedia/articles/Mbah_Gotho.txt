Saparman Sodimejo, known more commonly as Mbah Gotho (died 30 April 2017) was an Indonesian man who unverifiably claimed to be the oldest person ever recorded. 
In May 2010, Solopos reported that enumerators of that year's census had recorded his age next birthday as 142, which would have made him 19 years older than the official oldest recorded person, Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997. The Liputan 6 website reported that Mbah Gotho's estimated age was 140, and that he could not remember his date of birth but claimed to remember the construction of a sugar factory built in Sragen in 1880.
